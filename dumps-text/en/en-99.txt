Human evolution

   Wanting to understand who we are, where we come from and how we evolved
   is part of what makes us human.

   This an exciting time to be examining human evolution. Intriguing
   fossil and archaeological discoveries, combined with innovative
   techniques and DNA research, are transforming scientists' understanding
   of our ancient past.

   We now know of more than 20 hominin species that are part of our family
   tree. At least half of these species are based on fossils unearthed in
   the last 30 years.

   Museum scientists are at the forefront of research on the migration,
   characteristics and capabilities of these early human relatives, and
   the origin and cultural development of our species, Homo sapiens.

   Trace the evolution of humans since our lineage split from that of
   chimpanzees, explore what we have in common with our ancient relatives
   and discover research that is helping to answer questions about our
   past and future.
