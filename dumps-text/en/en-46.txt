Evolution

   Evolution is the way living organisms change over time, driven by
   natural selection.

   A revolutionary insight put forward by Charles Darwin in On the Origin
   of Species in 1859, the concept of natural selection was also touted by
   another British naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, who had come up with
   the idea at the same time.

   The two men hit upon a mechanism for evolution: all organisms vary and
   some variations are more beneficial than others, helping individuals
   thrive and preferentially pass them on to the next generation. In other
   words, these variations are naturally selected. (Darwin later outlined
   a similar mechanism, “sexual selection” whereby variations considered
   more attractive to the opposite sex are more likely to be passed on.)

   Natural selection requires that beneficial characteristics be passed
   from one generation to the next intact. It was not clear to Darwin how
   this might happen. However, at around the same time an Augustinian monk
   called Gregor Mendel was conducting experiments that held the answer.
   In 1866, he published results from studies of inheritance in pea
   plants, marking the birth of modern genetics. His discoveries went
   unnoticed for over three decades. Not long after they were
   rediscovered, genes were identified as units arranged along the
   chromosomes inside the cell’s nucleus. And in 1937, the “modern
   synthesis” brought these ideas together, defining evolution in genetic
   terms as the “change in the frequency of an allele [gene variant]
   within a gene pool”.

   Though it was made famous by Darwin, the idea of evolution actually
   predates him. By the early 19th century, developments in geology and
   mining had revealed Earth to be inconceivably ancient. It was also
   found to have changed over time, along with the forms of life that
   lived on it. One of the first people to try to explain how new species
   formed was Erasmus Darwin, Charles’s grandfather. Another influential
   early evolutionist was the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck,
   whose “transmutation of species” theory famously argued that change
   occurs when characteristics acquired during an organism’s lifetime are
   passed on to its offspring.

   In recent years, the theory of evolution itself has evolved. The idea
   that it is entirely driven by natural selection is challenged by new
   discoveries in genetics, epigenetics and developmental biology. There
   is growing evidence that genes do not have sole control over
   development and heredity, and that organisms play active roles in their
   own fate and that of their descendants. As a result, a growing number
   of biologists believe we need to extend our ideas of how evolution
   works.

   Evolution also faces a challenge from the rise of the religious
   creationist movement, which believes in the Bible’s account of the
   origins of life of Earth, and rejects evolution on this basis.
