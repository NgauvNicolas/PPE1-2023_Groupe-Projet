   David Baker’s Sex: Two Billion Years of Procreation and Recreation
   condenses the story of the evolution of (predominantly) reproductive
   sex into 300 pages. That is quite a feat.

   The book is one of the latest additions to the popular “Big History”
   genre. First defined by Macquarie University historian David Christian
   in the early 1990s, the idea of Big History is that the temporal scale
   on which history should be studied is “the whole of time”. Its ambition
   is no less than to survey history from the Big Bang to the present,
   taking an interdisciplinary approach to its scholarship.

   Baker is a science writer with a PhD in Big History and one of the
   writers behind the Big History Crash Course on YouTube. In his
   introduction to Sex, he declares “this is the first book that seeks to
   weave together the grand narrative of sex in its entirety”.

   Sex: Two Billion Years of Procreation and Recreation – David Christian
   (Black Inc.)

   The book is divided into three sections. The first – titled
   Evolutionary Foreplay – covers the period from 13.8 billion to 66
   million years ago. Baker races through the 10 billion years following
   the Big Bang, when “the cosmos was devoid of life”.

   He summarises the formation of Earth and its atmosphere, the origins of
   living organisms 3.8 billion years ago, the emergence of DNA, and the
   cloning (asexual reproduction) of “microscopic blobs living on the edge
   of underwater volcanoes”.

   We are taken from the earliest forms of sexual reproduction between two
   single-celled organisms to the differentiation of cells, and on to the
   evolution of specialised reproductive cells, the gametes. This
   development was followed by the rapid appearance of diverse animal
   species, from fish and amphibians to reptiles, insects, dinosaurs,
   birds and mammals.

   In the second section, Primate Climax – which covers the period from 66
   million to 315,000 years ago – we learn about the development of
   external genitals and the birth of “the age of the orgasm”, as well as
   primate sexual behaviour and social organisation.

   The final section, Cultural Afterglow, which extends from 315,000 years
   ago to the present, traces the history of Homo sapiens from
   hunter-gatherers, to the first agrarian societies, and on to the
   present day.

   The word length of each section is inversely proportional to the time
   scale being described – a reflection of our relative knowledge about
   sexual behaviour, but also its evolving complexity over time.

Evolution

   Baker’s prose is animated and deliberately raunchy, making what would
   be a dense read light and entertaining. But to weave his “grand
   narrative of sex” he also anthropomorphises reproduction of even the
   earliest living organisms.

   For example, explaining theory behind the first, possibly accidental,
   mixing of genes two billion years ago, Baker describes “Snowball Earth”
   – a period when the average global temperature was minus 50 degrees
   Celsius. His argument is that asexual reproduction at this time of
   catastrophic climatic conditions was causing overpopulation and that
   sexual reproduction would slow population growth.

   This sounds counter-intuitive, but sexual reproduction takes time, much
   longer than simply cloning oneself. Two separate, unrelated organisms
   need to find each other and then exchange DNA. And it seems that the
   very first time this happened was what Baker describes as “cannibal
   sex”: one cell ingesting another due to starvation and accidentally
   mixing DNA. Baker thus writes:

     To put it slightly more crudely, 2 billion years ago our ancestors
     felt so much pressure from the environment that they needed to fuck
     in order to survive.

   A few pages later, he writes “furthermore, sex bequeathed upon those
   hardy, horny eukaryotes the potential for rapid evolution into
   increasingly complex species”.

   Throughout his descriptions of sexual and reproductive behaviour of
   pre-primate species, Baker attributes very human characteristics to
   living organisms that simply don’t make sense. While this can be
   amusing, I also found it slightly irritating. The long bow being drawn
   between “sexual” behaviour involving the first exchange of DNA by
   single-celled organisms and the first modern humans is long indeed.

   Baker provides an interesting summary of the diversity among our
   primate ancestors. He notes differences in anatomy and genital size,
   and considers variations in practices such as masturbation and sexual
   partnering, including polygamy, monogamy, promiscuity, homosexual and
   bisexual behaviour.

   He delves into the issues of pleasure, romantic love and parenting, and
   related forms of social organisation, such as patriarchy and
   matriarchy. And he considers variations, such as patrilocality (where
   males remain in their families and females move out to live with the
   male parent of their offspring) and its reverse, matrilocality.

   Baker also points out that a pleasure response to copulation can be
   seen in fish and reptiles, similar to the sensations experienced after
   eating, but that the orgasm emerges with placental mammals.

   It is, however, the evolution of human culture that radically changes
   everything. Baker condenses a few hundred thousand years of the history
   of human sexuality into 150 pages. He covers diversity (including
   intersex characteristics and gender and sexual diversity) and considers
   the ways in which societies have controlled sexuality and sexual
   behaviour through legal and other sanctions.

   Central to these cultural practices is the control of female sexuality,
   which emerged with the development of agriculture and the need to
   retain land ownership and safeguard inheritance down patriarchal lines.

The future of sex

   In the book’s final chapter, The Future of Sex, Baker shares his belief
   that “Nurture has ceased to impede the sexual impulses of Nature”,
   leading to a state where “loneliness is at an all-time high and
   personal happiness is at its lowest ebb”.

   This is a sweeping statement. How did we measure loneliness and
   personal happiness in, say, Ancient Egypt? Do experiences of loneliness
   and personal happiness vary around the globe? Do they mean different
   things in different cultures?

   Informing some of Baker’s thinking are statistics about the number of
   Millennials “projected to never get married in their lifetimes” and the
   decline in rates of casual sex. But it is not clear if they are only
   from studies in Western countries or how representative they are at a
   global level.

   Baker concludes the book with four categories of future forecasts. His
   “projected future” is based on current observation. Here he predicts a
   rise in singledom and a state where promiscuity and sexlessness both
   exist and birth rates decline.

   His “probable future” anticipates a “cultural rejection of
   relationships as the key to happiness”. It would involve more hook-ups
   and the growing replacement of human-to-human sex with sex dolls and
   bots. Alternatively, Baker suggests humanity might swing back towards
   traditional monogamous couplings, or a revival of polygyny, or a
   “promiscuity overdrive”.

   In a “possible future”, he considers how internet technology might lead
   to virtual, AI-driven partnered sex. Finally, in a “preposterous
   future”, he suggests that sex could cease to be important to living
   organisms at all.

   While Baker’s deliberations are interesting and worth pondering, it is
   difficult to accept his claim that “the liberalisation of attitudes
   towards sex has released human sexuality from the grip of culture”.
   Indeed, the statement is something of an oxymoron, since “liberalising
   attitudes” are themselves a cultural phenomenon.

   The “grip of culture” is still ever-present in the policing of female
   sexual behaviour, which continues to the present day the world over. So
   does the epidemic of sexual violence against women.

   The other aspect of Baker’s book that I wonder about is its
   “knowability”. How many of the “facts” presented are really known? How
   much is be conjecture? While there is an impressive list of references
   at the end of the book, Baker admits that many of the beliefs he shares
   about the evolution of sex are not certain.

   This speaks, in part, to the tensions that exist between “Big History”
   and “Deep History”. Big History presents itself as an answer to an
   existential question – why are we here? But, as some critics have
   argued, humans do not “easily fit into a Big History framework”.

   Baker concludes with a statement about what he wanted to achieve in
   writing this book. He hopes that “some aspects of sex have become
   slightly less baffling for the reader” and wishes his readers the
   “sensation of feeling truly loved” – a kind sentiment, but slightly at
   odds with what has come before.

   From my perspective, the world has a long way to go to achieve human
   rights for all in the areas of sexuality and gender. If Baker’s book
   helps this endeavour by getting us to think about human sexuality more
   deeply, then it will prove worthwhile.
