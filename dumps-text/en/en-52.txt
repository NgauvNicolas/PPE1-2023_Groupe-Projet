Abstract

   What is the best way to teach evolution? As microevolution may be
   configured as a branch of genetics, it being a short conceptual leap
   from understanding the concepts of mutation and alleles (i.e.,
   genetics) to allele frequency change (i.e., evolution), we hypothesised
   that learning genetics prior to evolution might improve student
   understanding of evolution. In the UK, genetics and evolution are
   typically taught to 14- to 16-y-old secondary school students as
   separate topics with few links, in no particular order and sometimes
   with a large time span between. Here, then, we report the results of a
   large trial into teaching order of evolution and genetics. We modified
   extant questionnaires to ascertain students’ understanding of evolution
   and genetics along with acceptance of evolution. Students were assessed
   prior to teaching, immediately post teaching and again after several
   months. Teachers were not instructed what to teach, just to teach in a
   given order. Regardless of order, teaching increased understanding and
   acceptance, with robust signs of longer-term retention. Importantly,
   teaching genetics before teaching evolution has a significant (p <
   0.001) impact on improving evolution understanding by 7% in
   questionnaire scores beyond the increase seen for those taught in the
   inverse order. For lower ability students, an improvement in evolution
   understanding was seen only if genetics was taught first. Teaching
   genetics first additionally had positive effects on genetics
   understanding, by increasing knowledge. These results suggest a simple,
   minimally disruptive, zero-cost intervention to improve evolution
   understanding: teach genetics first. This same alteration does not,
   however, result in a significantly increased acceptance of evolution,
   which reflects a weak correlation between knowledge and acceptance of
   evolution. Qualitative focus group data highlights the role of
   authority figures in determination of acceptance.

Author summary

   What is the best way to teach evolution? We hypothesised that if
   students know the fundamental concepts of genetics, then this might
   help them understand evolution better. To evaluate this, we performed a
   large trial in which pupils in United Kingdom secondary schools were
   either taught genetics and then evolution or evolution and then
   genetics. We found that the students being taught genetics first had a
   5%–10% improvement in their understanding of evolution, above that
   shown in the group taught evolution first. The change was seen in both
   higher- and foundation-ability classes. Indeed, in the foundation
   classes the genetics-first approach was the only approach that enabled
   an increase in evolution understanding. Teaching genetics first comes
   at no cost to genetics understanding (and may even improve it).
   However, the genetics-first approach was no different from the
   evolution-first approach in helping the acceptance of evolution.
   Qualitative follow-up studies indicated a major role for authority
   figures in determining acceptance, potentially explaining the weak
   correlation between understanding and acceptance. These results suggest
   a simple, minimally disruptive, zero-cost intervention to improve
   evolution understanding: teach genetics first.

Introduction

   While Dobzhansky famously wrote, “nothing in biology makes sense except
   in the light of evolution” [1], evolution remains one of the most
   misunderstood topics in biology [2–4]. Despite its importance, public
   understanding and acceptance of evolution is considered poor [5,6].
   School-level teaching of evolution is, thus, important, at the very
   least because this is often potentially the first formal introduction
   many people have to the scientific understanding of the theory. There
   are, however, concerns over its unsatisfactory teaching [5,7,8]. Many
   studies suggest that not all teachers fully understand the theory of
   evolution [9–15] and that some teachers incorporate alternative
   nonscientific explanations within evolution lessons or even avoid the
   topic completely [8,10,16,17]. Students’ grasp of evolution is often
   poor and does not always agree with the scientific understanding
   [18–21]. Commensurately, numerous studies report low levels of
   understanding among first year undergraduate students [22–24]. These
   factors likely contribute to the poor public understanding of evolution
   reported by many researchers, including in the UK context [25,26]. This
   tempts the question, what are the best methods to teach evolution?

   This issue here is currently much debated, particularly at the
   secondary school level (e.g. [27–29]). This is because the theory of
   evolution can be a controversial issue [8,16,30]. Strong opposition is
   well documented in the United States (e.g., [31–39]), but there is
   increasing concern about the impact that religious movements or strong
   cultural and social traditions may have on evolution education in other
   countries, including Northern Ireland [40], Poland [41], Turkey [42],
   and the UK [25,43]. There are also concerns that creationism has been
   taught in UK schools and that religious-motivated groups have attempted
   to influence science lessons [25,43,44]. More generally, numerous
   studies have focused on impediments to understanding and acceptance of
   evolution. While religious orientation [42,45–47], prior
   acceptance/rejection of the theory of evolution [46,48,49], and views
   of authority figures including teachers and religious leaders
   [16,18,48] are commonly cited reasons, reasoning skills
   [18,19,45,48,50,51] are also considered to be of importance. However,
   there has been relatively little work focused on improving teaching and
   understanding of evolution. Much of the current evolution education
   research is based on university students or teachers and may not be
   applicable to school students. Secondary school level biology is
   usually compulsory for all students up to the age of 16, whereas
   university level courses are likely to be taken by more scientifically
   and academically oriented students, therefore studies related to
   university students need not be very meaningful for younger learners.

   Regardless of whether there is any real reason for concern, there is no
   research within the UK that we are aware of that investigates evolution
   acceptance and understanding amongst secondary school-aged students or
   that investigates factors that might impact understanding and
   acceptance. If concerns over evolution education are genuine, then
   research is needed to find the best way to improve the situation. If,
   however, there is less need for concern, UK students may provide an
   interesting research focus as to how best to teach evolution, which
   could be applicable not just within the UK but in countries where
   evolution acceptance is more problematic.

   As microevolution may be configured as a branch of genetics, it being a
   short conceptual leap from understanding the concepts of mutation and
   alleles (i.e., genetics) to allele frequency change (i.e., evolution),
   we hypothesised that learning genetics prior to evolution might improve
   student understanding of evolution. Prior research suggests a
   relationship between evolution acceptance and genetics understanding,
   or “genetic literacy,” exists [6]. This idea of a relationship between
   knowledge of genetics and acceptance of evolution has not been widely
   studied. It seems intuitive to hypothesise that good understanding of
   genetics should help understanding, and possibly acceptance, of
   evolution. DNA is the heritable material through which variation needed
   for evolution occurs. Moreover, as basic genetics (as opposed to
   applied genetics, genetically modified [GM] crops, cloning, etc.) is a
   relatively neutral subject and not considered controversial in the ways
   that evolution might be, teaching genetics first could be a means of
   improving evolution education without any concerns over potentially
   controversial issues.

   There are supporters of linking the teaching of evolution with
   genetics, but for the most part, this is based on opinion [28,52].
   There are also some that do not view a role for genetics as helpful,
   noting that Darwin didn’t know about genetics [53]. However, this
   argument would seem counterproductive, as the study of genetics does
   provide further understanding of, and evidence for, the theory of
   evolution. Moreover, Darwin’s argument for the logic of Natural
   Selection in the early chapters of the Origin of Species specifically
   required a heritable component [54]. There are rare examples of studies
   in which trial teaching programmes include a sequential aspect [19],
   but overall improvements in students’ understanding of evolution and
   genetics may have been linked to the constructivist nature of the
   teaching programme, rather than the order of topics or any links made
   between them. Clearly, there is scope for further work related to this.

   The test that we perform is based within the UK setting. Since the
   National Curriculum was introduced for schools in England and Wales in
   1988, evolution has been a compulsory part of secondary science classes
   and is currently included in GCSE (General Certificate of Education)
   science and biology examination courses, typically taught to
   14–16-year-olds [25,55]. This is when most students are first
   introduced to the theory of evolution during their school education.
   Parenthetically, this situation is changing, as evolution was
   introduced to the primary curriculum in 2014. This does not affect the
   students involved in this research study, but it will be very
   interesting to see if and how this earlier introduction impacts
   students as they progress onto secondary school and beyond.

   The secondary school biology GCSE courses involved in this research
   project contain separate modules or topics featuring evolution and
   genetics. Most of these do not specifically link evolution and
   genetics, despite the obvious relationship between the two. According
   to exam board specifications and many secondary school textbooks,
   evolution is supported by fossil evidence, but there is rarely any
   mention of genetics. Students are generally taught within “higher”- or
   “foundation”- ability classes, and the hours of tuition and exact
   content studied varies between these sets. Although both genetics and
   evolution are taught to secondary school-aged students, the order of
   these topics depends on exam boards and school or teacher preference,
   and topics are not necessarily taught consecutively.

   We hypothesise that if students learn about genetics before evolution,
   this simple intervention could have a positive impact on learning. Our
   motivation for this test is not simply one based on some limited prior
   data and intuition. Rather, at least within the UK context, teachers
   are under unprecedented pressures, be these of time, resources, or
   regular changes to the curriculum. For a suggested change to teaching
   practices to have scope to be readily adopted, we sought to find
   interventions that are cost free, minimally disruptive, and require no
   further changes to what is taught. Thus, in our trial all that was
   changed was the order of teaching of material; exactly what was to be
   taught was left to teachers’ discretion. Moreover, what they were
   teaching is constrained by the stipulations of the different exam
   boards. Our experimental design thus attempts to mimic what would
   happen were any new ordering to be made policy.

   In brief, we asked teachers to teach in 1 of 2 orders: genetics first
   or evolution first. As it would be unethical to request some students
   not to be taught both subjects, we have no control. Our design may be
   considered a version of a crossover design [56]. The students were
   tested before being taught, immediately after and then several months
   after. Student response we define in 3 dimensions: understanding of
   evolution, understanding of genetics, and acceptance of evolution.
   Understanding of evolution (and genetics) refers to knowledge of a
   subject and practical application of this knowledge (here, evolution
   and genetics) and is different from acceptance, which refers to
   agreement with an idea or theory or the recognition that a position is
   valid or correct (here, the theory of evolution). The quantitative
   tests were modifications of accepted tests of genetics understanding,
   evolution understanding, and evolution acceptance. We followed up with
   more limited quantitative analysis from interviews with students. With
   a large number of classes being analysed, we presumed that our attempts
   to randomise which teacher teaches in which order would remove teacher,
   class, or cohort effects. Sample sizes for the longer-term retention
   are limited, and we could only assess general trends, not order
   effects. We noted when schools divided students between high- and
   foundation-ability classes and stratified with respect to this
   variable.

   We ask first whether teaching has any demonstrable impact on
   understanding and whether “ability” has any effect. “Ability” is very
   crudely used as an estimate of intelligence, which in itself is highly
   debated and complex to define. Here, ability is based on whether
   students are set within a higher-ability class and likely to be entered
   for a higher-tier exam, or whether they are within a lower-ability set
   and entered for a foundation-tier exam. We then ask whether teaching
   order affects the extent of change in understanding of evolution and of
   genetics. Importantly, we find evidence that teaching genetics first
   improves the understanding of evolution, but also of genetics, more
   than teaching evolution first improves both understandings. Indeed, in
   the foundation class evolution understanding goes up only if genetics
   is taught first. Finally, we address the issue of whether the same
   intervention affects acceptance of evolution. We find no evidence that
   teaching order modulates increases in evolution acceptance. This
   possibly stems from the weak correlation between understanding of
   evolution and acceptance. We employed a qualitative methodology to
   explore possible reasons for this.

Results

Understanding of genetics and evolution

Teaching has a positive impact on knowledge of evolution and genetics

   If one of the purposes of education is to impart knowledge, then one
   would hope that teaching has a positive impact on students’
   understanding of the topics being taught. We examined whether this is
   the case for evolution and genetics. Teaching has a positive impact on
   knowledge of genetics, (Fig 1A, Z = 177,834 p < .001) and on knowledge
   of evolution (Fig 1B, Z = 130,876.5, p < .001). Students’ knowledge of
   genetics increased by 2 marks (6%) on average, and by half a mark (8%)
   for evolution knowledge, but there was a wide range of variation.
   Teaching only had a positive impact on the evolution knowledge of 48%
   of students. 26% showed no change, and 26% showed a decrease in
   understanding.

   acceptance—pre: n = 388, post: n = 365, retention: n = 329).

   Raw data can be found in S1 and S2 Data.

Higher-ability students gain more knowledge of evolution

   Teaching has a positive impact on evolution understanding for
   higher-ability students (Z = 95,800.5, p < .001) and for foundation
   students, (Z = 2,746, p < .001). However, higher-ability students have
   a greater level of evolution understanding before teaching (W =
   223,415.5, p < .001) and after teaching (W = 169,066, p < .001). A
   linked matching pairs approach has been taken to further investigate
   the differences between ability groups. In this, we consider
   individuals of equal score in the preteaching scores, pairing those
   from different strata. We then consider the difference in increment in
   score for each pair. We then compare the values of these differential
   increments between the strata. By doing so, any influences that
   determined preteaching score are effectively eliminated as a covariate.

   Both groups show a significant increase in understanding evolution
   (higher: Z = 2,888.5, p < .001, lower: Z = 2,746, p < .001), but there
   is a significant difference between the groups after teaching, with
   higher-ability students showing a greater understanding of evolution
   compared to those from foundation sets (W = 43761, p < .001), even when
   students start with the same understanding of evolution. ANCOVA
   predicting score change as a function of ability with pretest score as
   a covariate similarly finds an affect of ability, with higher-ability
   students having higher change scores (estimate 0.32, p = 0.002). This
   result might suggest that current teaching practices work best for
   higher-ability students.

Higher-ability students gain more knowledge of genetics

   Teaching also has a positive impact on understanding of genetics both
   for higher-ability students (Z = 114,023, p < .001) and for foundation
   students (Z = 6,757, p < .001). Again, higher-ability students have a
   greater level of genetics understanding before teaching, (W =
   349,326.5, p < .001), and after teaching (W = 239,010.5, p < .001) (Fig
   2).

   = 1,203, lower post: n = 284).

   Raw data can be found in S1 and S2 Data.

   A linked approach has been used again to further analyse the
   differences between ability groups. Both groups show a significant
   increase in genetics knowledge (higher: Z = 3,619.5, p < .001, lower: Z
   = 6,149.5, p < .001). There is a significant difference between the
   groups after teaching, with higher-ability students showing a greater
   understanding of genetics compared to those from lower-ability sets (W
   = 52,836.5, p < .001), even when students start with the same
   understanding of genetics. This is confirmed by a comparison of the
   change in scores for each ability group (W = 35,224, p < .001). ANCOVA
   predicting score change as a function of ability with pretest score as
   a covariate similarly finds an affect of ability (estimate 1.2, p
   <0.0001). Again, this suggests that current teaching practices work
   best for the higher-ability students.

Teaching genetics first increases evolution knowledge

   Does the teaching order—genetics or evolution first—make a difference
   to learning outcome? Teaching has a positive impact on evolution
   knowledge for those students who are taught genetics first (Z = 42,704,
   p < .001) and for those who are taught evolution first (Z = 23,566, p <
   .001). The 2 groups are not significantly different prior to learning
   these topics (W = 302,352.2, p = 0.5.), but those students who were
   taught genetics first have significantly higher post-teaching test
   scores than those who were taught evolution first (W = 267,270, p <
   .001). The change in scores was thus significantly different, with
   those learning genetics first showing a greater increase in evolution
   knowledge (W = 151,199.5, p < .001) (Fig 3). This change reflects a
   mean difference of 0.4 marks, representing a 7% adjustment in
   understanding. A linked approach was also utilised and confirmed these
   findings: those students who learned genetics first showed a greater
   increase in evolution knowledge than those who learned evolution first
   (W = 166,702.5, p < .001). Similarly, ANCOVA with change predicted as a
   function of order with pretest scores as a covariate find that genetics
   first improves scores most (estimate 0.35, p < 0.0001). We note that
   these p values are robust to multitest correction. We note too that
   whether or not a teacher changed their order of teaching doesn’t
   predict the change in evolution knowledge (W = 70,474, p = 0.25).

Teaching genetics first is best for improving genetics knowledge

   Above, we have shown that teaching genetics first appears to lead to
   increased understanding of evolution. Does this come at a cost to
   improvement of genetics understanding? One could reasonably argue that
   there is no advantage to teaching genetics first if the net result is
   an increase in evolution knowledge but at a cost of genetics
   understanding. We find that, if anything, teaching genetics first
   increases both genetic and evolution understanding.

   Those taught using either topic order show an increase in genetics
   knowledge (genetics first: Z = 63,098, p < .001, evolution first: Z =
   28,941, p < .001). The 2 groups are, however, significantly different
   both before teaching (W = 428,985, p < .001) and after (W = 352,946.5,
   p < .001) in their genetics understanding. As they differed prior to
   teaching, a linked data approach was taken to compare students in the
   different tranches who had the same understanding prior to teaching.
   Again, students taught both topic orders show a significant increase in
   genetics understanding (genetics first: Z = 18,289, p < .001 and
   evolution first: Z = 25,277, p < .001), but those who learn about
   genetics first have significantly higher post-teaching test scores than
   those students who learn about evolution first (W = 173251, p < .001).
   The change in scores is also significantly different, with those
   learning genetics first showing a greater increase in genetics
   knowledge (W = 129,838, p < .001). The difference in change is 1.1
   marks, which represents a difference of 3.5%. Allowing for differences
   in pretest scores via an ANCOVA (change predicted as a function of
   order with pretest scores as a covariate) supports the value of
   teaching genetics first (estimate 1.32; p < 0.0001; Fig 4). We note too
   that whether or not a teacher changed their normal order of teaching
   (if there was one) doesn’t predict the change in genetics knowledge (W
   = 76,988, p = 0.56).

   Here, we employ the subset of 4 pupils who completed all pre- and all
   postquestionanaires. Raw data can be found in S1 and S2 Data.

Acceptance of evolution

   Having seen that teaching has a positive impact on understanding of
   evolution and genetics, we now consider whether teaching has an impact
   on acceptance of evolution. We then consider whether student ability or
   the order in which topics are taught have any impact on evolution
   acceptance.

Teaching of evolution increases acceptance rates

   The majority of students are accepting of evolution, even before
   learning about the topic in secondary school. 78% of 1,712 students
   accept evolution before they have learned about it. Of the remaining
   students, 21% are undecided, and only 1% do not show acceptance towards
   evolution. This suggests that most students are open to learning about
   evolution in school (and indeed this was found within focus groups).
   Education has an overall positive impact on evolution acceptance. The
   proportion of 1,519 students who accept evolution increases to 85%,
   with only 14% of students undecided about evolution. 1% of students
   still have low acceptance. For definitions of acceptance
   categorisation, see Methods.

   In order to better understand the changes due to teaching, acceptance
   scores from individual students are compared. Overall, teaching has a
   small but highly significant positive impact on students’ acceptance of
   evolution (Z = 175,242.5, p < .001) (Fig 1C). The average change in
   score is 2, which represents a 3% increase in acceptance. However,
   acceptance does not increase for all students: 2/3 demonstrate a
   positive change, 9% display no change, and 1/4 show a decrease in
   acceptance score. Not all of these changes involve marked differences,
   but it might be noteworthy that such a large proportion of students
   show some decrease in acceptance. Overall, we see that students that
   show larger increases in understanding of both genetics and evolution
   show larger increases in evolution acceptance (Spearman correlations:
   change in acceptance versus changes in genetics understanding: R[s] =
   0.1, p < 0.0001; change in acceptance versus changes in evolution
   understanding: R[s] = 0.07, p = 0.013). There is no significant
   difference in the strength of these correlations (Monte Carlo
   simulation, p = 0.39). This supports the view that acceptance follows
   from increased understanding.

Higher-ability students have greater acceptance of evolution

   Teaching has a positive impact on acceptance of evolution for both
   higher-ability students (Z = 114,312, p < .001) and foundation-ability
   groups of students (Z = 6,374.5, p < .001). However, higher-ability
   students had a greater level of evolution acceptance before teaching
   than foundation-ability students (W = 325,619.5, p < .001), as well as
   after teaching (W = 240,955.5, p < .001) (Fig 5).

   Acceptance of evolution for higher- and foundation-ability students,

   1,354, foundation pre: n = 358, higher post: n = 1,203, foundation
   post: n = 284).

   Raw data can be found in S1 and S2 Data.

   Whether teaching makes a difference to acceptance that is different
   between the high- and foundation-ability students isn’t so clear. As
   these 2 groups were significantly different before teaching, a linked
   data approach was taken to further analyse a subsample of these data.
   Both groups show a significant increase in acceptance after teaching
   (higher: Z = 4,765, p < .001, lower: Z = 6,337.5, p < .001). While
   there is a significant difference between the groups after teaching
   with higher-ability students showing a greater acceptance of evolution,
   compared to those from lower-ability sets (W = 58,036, p = .03), this
   result is marginal and is sensitive to Bonferonni correction.
   Similarly, an effect of ability in score change is not found within an
   ANCOVA, in which change in score is predicted by ability controlling
   for pretest score (p for effect of ability, = 0.54).

Topic order has no impact on evolution acceptance

   Having shown that teaching order affects evolution understanding and
   that teaching increases evolution acceptance, we now ask whether
   teaching order affects evolution acceptance as would seem a logical
   corollary of these 2 prior results. Students taught evolution first and
   students taught genetics first both showed significant increase in
   evolution acceptance after teaching (genetics first: Z = 67,718, p <
   .001, evolution first: Z = 25,183.5, p < .001). However, these initial
   comparisons also revealed that the 2 groups were significantly
   different before they learned about evolution and genetics (W =
   377,746.5, p = .005), but not significantly different after learning
   about these topics (W = 289,152.5, p = .07). The reasons for this are
   unknown. A linked data approach was taken to compare students who had
   the same acceptance prior to teaching. There was no significant
   difference found between the different topics after teaching (W =
   168,338.5 p = .667), and the change in acceptance score is not
   predicted by teaching order in an ANCOVA (p = 0.85).

Acceptance of evolution is more strongly correlated with genetics
understanding than evolution understanding

   Given that teaching improves evolution acceptance and understanding,
   and teaching order makes a difference to evolution understanding, it is
   curious that we detect no order effect on evolution acceptance. One
   possible reason for this is that the correlation between evolution
   understanding and acceptance is weak, and hence a small difference in
   understanding (owing to topic order) translates into such a small
   incremental difference in acceptance as to be beyond our resolution,
   even with comparatively large sample sizes. We thus ask about the
   correlation between acceptance and understanding.

   Even before teaching, there is a moderate, positive relationship
   between evolution acceptance and genetics understanding (R[s] = 0.42 p
   < .001). Importantly, there is a strikingly weaker positive
   relationship observed between evolution acceptance and evolution
   understanding (R[s] = 0.24 p < .001) and between knowledge of genetics
   and knowledge of evolution (R[s] = 0.19, p < .001). The correlation
   between genetics understanding and evolution acceptance is
   significantly stronger than that between evolution understanding and
   evolution acceptance (Monte Carlo simulation, p < 0.0001). We conclude
   that, perhaps surprisingly, genetics understanding correlates better
   with evolution acceptance than evolution understanding does.

   In order to better understand the part knowledge plays in acceptance,
   partial correlations were calculated for the 2 principal variables. The
   correlation between evolution acceptance and genetics knowledge, given
   understanding of evolution, is rho = 0.39. The correlation between
   evolution acceptance and evolution knowledge, controlling for genetics
   knowledge, is only 0.18. Both results are highly significant (p <
   .001). Again, the correlation between genetics knowledge and evolution
   acceptance appears to be stronger than that between evolution knowledge
   and evolution acceptance.

   Correlations after teaching between evolution acceptance, genetics
   understanding, and evolution understanding all appear similar to those
   seen prior to teaching. There is significant, robust positive
   correlation between acceptance of evolution and knowledge of genetics
   (R[s] = 0.41 p < .001), between acceptance of evolution and knowledge
   of evolution (R[s] = 0.27 p < .001), and between understanding of
   evolution and knowledge of genetics (R[s] = 0.39 p < .001) after
   teaching (Fig 6) (Correlations of all pre- and postrelationships can be
   found in Table 1). Partial correlations, again, show very similar
   correlations as seen previously: the correlation between evolution
   acceptance and genetics knowledge, controlling for evolution knowledge,
   is stronger than that between evolution acceptance and evolution
   knowledge (Table 2). The correlation between genetics understanding and
   evolution acceptance is again significantly stronger than that between
   evolution understanding and evolution acceptance (Monte Carlo
   simulation, p < 0.001).

   All correlations are highly significant (p < .001). These pretests were

   all 3 assessments to be completed (n = 1,397). Raw data can be found in

   Here, we employ the subset of data for pupils who completed all pre-

   purposes alone. Raw data can be found in S1 and S2 Data.

   These results suggest that a unit increase in evolution understanding
   is likely to have only a very small incremental effect on evolution
   acceptance as the correlation between the 2 is weak both before and
   after teaching. Thus, it is logically possible that a small increment
   to evolution understanding (owing to order effects) translates as only
   a very small increase in the weakly-correlated evolution acceptance,
   too weak to be detectable by us. It is notable that the strongest
   relationship is seen between evolution acceptance and genetics
   knowledge. While causality here is unclear and may reflect little more
   than underlying ability, this we highlight as a most enigmatic result.
   It also lays the basis for the hypothesis that better understanding of
   genetics may be an optimal strategy, if the desired end is increase in
   both evolution understanding and evolution acceptance. This, we
   suggest, is worthy of further scrutiny.

Qualitative analysis suggests authority conditions acceptance

   Our results show the positive impact on evolution understanding that
   teaching has and factors that impact this—most importantly, topic
   order. Teaching also has a positive impact on acceptance. Why, then,
   might acceptance and understanding be so poorly correlated? Qualitative
   data collected from focus groups suggest that not what is taught, but
   who evolution is taught by, is more important for acceptance. Many
   students were happy to admit that they accept evolution because it’s
   what they had been told by their parents or taught by their teachers,
   although a few students acknowledged that this is something most people
   tend to do when they are young:

     “Because that’s what we’ve been told […] that’s what I believe.”

     —(Year 10 student)

     “I was told by my parents when I was younger because you believe
     what your parents say when you’re young.”

     —(Year 10 student)

     “I don’t think that we’re being lied to at all […] I just don’t
     think it’s like a conspiracy theory.”

     —(Year 9 student)

     “I don’t know if there is such evidence [for evolution], we’ve just
     been told that this is right.”

     —(Year 9 student)

   Important figures were not just people that students knew. Television
   documentaries were commonly given as a source of information about
   evolution, and some students felt these, and their presenters, were
   important in helping them accept evolution:

     “Even in like TV programmes they make it really convincing as well.”

     —(Year 11 student)

     “Well, if David Attenborough believes in it then why shouldn’t
     everyone else?”

     —(Year 10 student)

   The use of “belief” as opposed to “accept” is common among students,
   perhaps indicating lack of understanding of differences between science
   and religion. The importance of religious beliefs was clearly important
   for some students, with some envisaging that they should pick “either
   one or the other.” But here, knowledge of authority figures within
   their religion was also important:

     “I’m religious so that’s why I kind of find it difficult […] the
     first lesson I kind of—I kind of wanted to argue that actually God
     put everyone there but then I kind of also believe in science a lot
     so I was really confused the first lesson but—but then Miss was like
     ‘Oh yeah, the Pope actually agrees with some of the theories behind
     it’ so I kind of accepted it but don’t strongly believe in it […] I
     kind of just accepted because the Pope kind of believed in some of
     the theories that I could as well.”

     —(Year 10 student)

   This student had initially felt uncomfortable about learning evolution
   due to their religious beliefs, but having the knowledge that their
   religion accepted evolution was of importance. It ensured that they
   were able to learn about evolution and not cause any disruption to the
   class. It could be argued that there are underlying issues here and
   that, ideally, students should have a better understanding of the
   nature of science and its differences from religion. However, if this
   simple teacher intervention can ensure religious students are more
   comfortable and open to learning about evolution, this may appear a
   defensible approach to take.

Teaching genetics first improves understanding for students of all abilities

   Given the key findings regarding topic order, combined with the strong
   evidence found that ability has a big impact on evolution acceptance
   and evolution and genetics understanding, it is important to ask
   whether the topic order effect observed in the previous section is
   independent of ability. This is for 2 reasons. First, there is the
   purely statistical concern that if high-ability students show more
   improvement and more of such students learned genetics first, the
   trends seen need not be explained in terms of order effects. Second,
   teaching high-ability students is often not so much of a challenge,
   while finding effective mechanisms to teach the lower-ability classes
   can be challenging. To address both these issues, we analyse the order
   effects stratified by ability.

   A comparison of the proportion of higher- and foundation-ability
   students within the 2 topic orders can be found in Table 3. From this,
   it is clear that, for reasons unknown, foundation-ability students
   tended to be taught evolution first. To address the statistical concern
   as well as the pedagogical concern, analysis is therefore needed to
   distinguish the impact of topic order from that of ability. The
   different topic orders for both higher- and foundation-ability groups
   have therefore been compared.

Teaching genetics first is best for increasing evolution knowledge for both
higher- and foundation-ability students

   Higher-ability students show significant increase in evolution
   understanding regardless of which topic order they are taught first
   (genetics first: Z = 33,239.5, p < .001, evolution first: Z = 15,882.5,
   p = .004). The 2 order groups were not significantly different before
   teaching (W = 195,495.5, p = .7), but higher-ability students who
   learned about genetics first demonstrate greater evolution knowledge
   after teaching than those who were taught evolution first (W =
   1,777,056.5, p = .005). Similarly, there is a significant difference
   between the change in scores, with those taught genetics first showing
   the greater increase in knowledge of evolution (Fig 7.; W = 178,140, p
   = 1.4 x 10^−5). The difference in change was, on average, a 6.4%
   increase in knowledge of evolution.

   Change in understanding of evolution due to teaching for higher-ability
   students taught genetics first (n = 683) and evolution first (n = 372)
   and for foundation-ability students taught genetics first (n = 93) and
   evolution first (n = 79).

   Data plotted here is for the subset of the data in which all students
   answered all pre- and postquestionnaires. Raw data can be found in S1
   and S2 Data.

   Perhaps most striking, we find that within the foundation-ability
   students, only those that were taught genetics first saw a significant
   increase in evolution understanding (genetics first: Z = 599, p < .001,
   evolution first: Z = 758, p = 0.9). Those who learned about genetics
   first showed a greater increase in understanding compared to those who
   were taught evolution first (Fig 7; W = 24,172, p = 0.025, sensitive to
   Bonferonni correction). This represents a difference of about 9% in
   change in scores.

   In addition, we performed a multivariate regression to predict change
   in evolution, understanding scores with ability and topic order as
   factors, and pretest score as a covariate. This reveals that both topic
   order (estimate 0.34, p < 0.001) and ability (estimate 0.28, p =
   0.0065) are predictors, as discussed above, with genetics first being
   beneficial.

Teaching genetics first increases genetics knowledge for higher- and
foundation-ability students

   As mentioned before, it is important to ascertain whether the teaching
   of genetics first comes at a cost to poorer increased understanding of
   genetics. We find that teaching genetics first appears to improve
   genetics understanding for both ability groups. Higher-ability students
   show a significant increase in genetics understanding regardless of
   which topic order they are taught first (genetics first: Z = 45,985, p
   < .001, evolution first: Z = 15,202.5, p < .001). However, the 2 groups
   are significantly different before (W = 263,571.5, p < .001) and after
   (W = 222,113.5, p < .001) teaching. Therefore, a linked data approach
   has been utilised to further investigate these changes. Again, both
   linked groups show a significant increase in knowledge (genetics first:
   Z = 10,050, p < .001, evolution first: Z = 13,372, p < .001). There is
   a significant difference between the 2 groups after teaching (W =
   91,467.5, p < 0.001) with those who learned about genetics first having
   higher post-teaching scores than those who were taught evolution first.
   Those who learned genetics first also show a greater increase in
   knowledge than those taught evolution first (W = 70,724.5, p = .002),
   supported also by ANCOVA (estimate 1.2, p = 1.4 x 10^−7).

   Foundation-ability students also show a significant increase in
   genetics understanding regardless of which topic order they are taught
   first (genetics first: Z = 1,342, p < .001, evolution first: Z =
   2,099.5, p < .001). The 2 groups were not significantly different
   before teaching (W = 16,048.5, p = .97), but foundation-ability
   students who learned about genetics first demonstrated greater genetics
   knowledge than those who were taught evolution first (W = 12,162, p =
   .002). There was a significant difference between the change in scores
   with those taught genetics first showing the greater change in
   knowledge of genetics (W = 7,933.5, p = .03; sensitive to multitest
   correction) and is supported by ANCOVA (estimate 2.0, p = 0.006). The
   average increase represents a 5% increase in knowledge of genetics.

   In addition, we performed a multivariate regression to predict change
   in genetics understanding scores with ability and topic order as
   factors and pretest score as a covariate. This reveals that both topic
   order (estimate 1.3, p < 0.0001) and ability (estimate = 1.2, p =
   0.0001) are predictors as discussed above, with genetics first being
   beneficial.

Topic order has no impact on evolution acceptance in both ability groups

   Above, we found no significant effect of topic order on evolution
   acceptance. Does this apply to both ability groups? Higher-ability
   students taught either topic order show a significant increase in
   evolution acceptance (genetics first: Z = 47,143.5, p < .001, evolution
   first: Z = 14,699, p < .001). The 2 groups are significantly different
   before learning about evolution and genetics (W = 228,160, p = .01) but
   are similar after teaching (W = 179,555, p = .05). A linked approach is
   again used and again finds that both groups show a significant increase
   in knowledge after teaching (genetics first: Z = 12,390.5, p < .001,
   evolution first: Z = 14,552, p < .001). There is no significant
   difference between the post-teaching scores of the 2 groups (W =
   91,474, p = .06), nor is there any difference in the amount of change
   between the 2 topic orders (W = 78,153, p = .06).

   Similarly, foundation-ability students show a significant increase in
   acceptance of evolution, regardless of topic order (genetics first: Z =
   1,822, p < .001, evolution first: Z = 1,370, p < .001). The 2 groups
   are not significantly different before (W = 14,718.5, p = .1) or after
   (W = 10,405.5, p = .05) teaching. There was also no significant
   difference in the amount of change between the 2 order groups (W =
   6,856.5, p = .1). In addition, we performed a multivariate regression
   to predict change in evolution acceptance scores with ability and topic
   order as factors and pretest score as a covariate. This reveals that
   neither topic order (p < 0.88) nor ability (p = 0.55) are predictors.

   In summary, findings related to topic order are not due to covariance
   with ability of students and, crucially, teaching genetics first helps
   both ability groups with no detriment to genetics understanding. That
   is to say, teaching genetics first increases understanding of evolution
   and genetics for both higher- and foundation-ability students. Topic
   order appears to have no impact on evolution acceptance, regardless of
   academic ability.

Teaching has long lasting effects on acceptance and understanding

   The previous results have all compared understanding and acceptance
   immediately before and after students have learned about evolution and
   genetics. In order to better understand what happens after time has
   lapsed since teaching, we ask whether students retain this knowledge
   and level of acceptance. This is an important consideration: if
   students show an increase in knowledge immediately after teaching, but
   then return to their preteaching level a few months later, it could be
   argued that education is not successful. Unfortunately, our sample size
   is too low to say anything meaningful about whether topic order has any
   effects on longer-term retention or to stratify this by ability.

   These data are purely a subsection of all data: pre- and postdata are
   only included for classes that completed a retention test (therefore,
   numbers and statistical tests may vary slightly from results reported
   previously). The timing of the retention test varied between classes
   but was generally 3 to 6 months after these topics were taught, and did
   not correspond to any revision or examination of evolution or genetics.
   For many students, secondary school may be the last (if not only) time
   they learn about evolution. The responses found within these retention
   tests may therefore be representative of students’ lasting thoughts and
   understandings of these topics.

   Although a smaller cohort, the subsection of students who completed the
   questionnaire retention test are not significantly different from the
   larger student sample whose questionnaire results are reported
   previously. They also show the same trend of significant increases in
   acceptance and understanding immediately after teaching, as were seen
   in students sampled previously, and are thus thought to be
   representative of the larger sample.

   Teaching has a positive and long-term impact on evolution acceptance,
   genetics understanding, and evolution understanding. As previously
   observed, students show significant increase in acceptance and
   understanding immediately after learning about evolution and genetics
   (evolution acceptance: Z = 8,749.5, p < .001; genetics understanding: Z
   = 8,574.5, p < .001; evolution understanding: Z = 8,269, p < .001).
   Perhaps surprisingly, evolution acceptance and evolution understanding
   have not changed significantly by the time of the retention test
   (evolution acceptance: Z = 16,879, p = .63; evolution understanding: Z
   = 7,479; p = .054). Genetics understanding decreased significantly
   between the post-teaching and retention tests (Z = 12,560.5, p < .048).
   However, understanding at the point of the retention test is still
   significantly higher than that prior to teaching (Z = 5,196.5, p <
   .001). These results are all shown in Fig 1.

No evidence for intraclass underdispersion (teacher effects)

   Above, we have performed all analyses at the level of the student,
   ignoring possible nonindependence between data owing to the fact that
   the class has the same teacher (although this wasn’t always true). If
   any such effect is confounding our analysis, we should see lower
   intraclass variation in changes in scores than expected. In the most
   extreme circumstance, we expect all students under an “excellent”
   teacher to show equally large changes in scores, while those under a
   less competent teacher would show equally little changes in scores.
   Thus, in both incidences, at the limit, the intraclass variance in the
   change in scores would be zero.

   To investigate this possibility, we calculate for each class (with more
   than 2 students reporting before and after data) the normalised
   intraclass variance in change. As we are concerned with the magnitude
   of the variation independent of the between-class variation in mean
   change, we normalise by the intraclass mean to calculate the dispersion
   index, which equals variance within class in change divided by mean
   class change. The overall reporting statistic is the mean of all the
   per-class dispersion index values.

   To determine whether the observed mean dispersion is lower than
   expected, we perform a nonparametric Monte Carlo simulation. We then
   take each student again and randomly allocate a change score, the
   values being taken from those used to calculate the real mean
   dispersion. The random allocation is done without replacement, so each
   change score is used once in the real data and once in each
   randomization. For each Monte Carlo simulation, we then repeat the
   above analysis to generate a mean dispersion for all pseudoclasses
   (note that class structure is maintained intact, thus also controlling
   for class size effects).

   If there were a teacher-effect causing nonindependence between data
   (i.e., under dispersion), we expect to see a lower mean dispersion in
   the real data than in randomized data (at the limit, all students
   within any given class go up or down to the same degree, dispersion = 0
   as variance = 0). The significance of any reduction will be given by p
   = (n+1)/(m+1), where n is the number of randomizations in which the
   randomized dispersion is lower than or as low as that observed in the
   real data (i.e., a 1-tailed expectation). We ran each simulation 10,000
   times for each of the 3 scores measures. In no case did we observe
   anything even approaching a significantly lower mean dispersion than
   expected by chance (evolution acceptance, p = 0.77; evolution
   knowledge, p = 0.56; genetics knowledge, p = 0.22). To check that this
   wasn’t an artefact of high variance when there are few recorded
   samples, we reanalysed requiring a minimum of 6 change calculations per
   class. We again find no evidence for underdispersion (evolution
   acceptance, p = 0.78; evolution knowledge, p = 0.58; genetics
   knowledge, p = 0.17). Analysing each of the 3 questions stratified into
   high and low groups similarly finds no evidence for underdispersion
   (even though the test is 1-tailed and not multitest corrected, Pmin =
   0.12, Pmax = 0.82). We conclude that we see no evidence that dispersion
   within classes is lower than expected under a null random model and
   thus consider both that we see no teacher-effects and that it is
   appropriate to analyse at the level of the student.

Class-level analysis supports the utility of teaching genetics first

   While the above result indicates that analysis at the student level is
   appropriate, it is also helpful to ask whether a much more conservative
   class-level analysis provides any support for the hypothesis that
   teaching genetics first improves evolution understanding. To address
   this, we calculated for each class a mean change (post score −
   prescore) for each of the 3 parameters (acceptance and understanding x
   2). We then performed Mann Whitney U tests for each of the 3
   parameters, comparing those classes taught evolution first with those
   taught genetics first.

   Even though the sample sizes are much more restricted than in the
   student-focused analysis (just 70 classes in which we have at least 1
   student doing all the pre tests and all the post tests), nonetheless we
   see that teaching genetics first significantly improves evolution
   understanding (p = 0.004), with the mean class increase in score being
   approximately double that of the evolution-first treatment (Table 4).
   Stratifying this by ability leads to an even more conservative test, as
   we have only 18 qualifying foundation-ability classes. Even in this
   stratification, however, we still see that teaching genetics first
   improves evolution understanding compared to the opposite order,
   although the effect is significant only in the larger sample size
   high-ability class (p = 0.006), where “genetics-first” changes in
   scores are over 2.5 times greater than with evolution-first (Table 4).
   In the foundation-ability class, evolution understanding change scores
   are improved in the genetics-first order, but not significantly so.
   This may be a sample size issue, as with only 9 classes in each
   partition we couldn’t likely detect a 5%–10% effect even if there were
   one. We see no evidence that genetics understanding is adversely
   affected by being taught first (Table 4) and, again, no evidence that
   evolution acceptance is affected by ordering (Table 4).

Discussion

   Our results suggest that, at least in the UK setting, teaching of
   evolution and genetics is in a constructive position. Teaching improves
   understanding and acceptance, these increases showing strong signs of
   longer-term retention. Overall, evolution acceptance is high among the
   diverse secondary school students that we sampled, increasing to 85%
   after teaching. This being said, some students spoke in the focus
   groups of expecting there to be more evidence for evolution than was
   presented in their lessons, this suggesting possible improvements.

   Most importantly, topic order is implicated in increasing understanding
   of these topics: students who are taught genetics before evolution have
   significantly greater knowledge of evolution and genetics, compared to
   students who are taught evolution first. Importantly, this same
   strategy appears not to be to the detriment of genetics understanding,
   which, if anything, is also improved by teaching genetics first. This
   suggests a simple, cost-free, minimally disruptive process to improve
   evolution understanding: namely, teaching genetics first. Importantly,
   too, for the foundation-ability students, only if genetics was taught
   first do we see an improvement in evolution knowledge. Given that there
   is so little cost in such a change, even if the results of our analysis
   were to prove not to be replicable, we can see little-to-no downside of
   this small switch in teaching practice. Given that teaching genetics
   first appears to be the only strategy that improves evolution
   understanding for those of foundation ability, we suggest that it might
   be negligent not to adopt this practice. Given, too, the strong
   correlation between genetics understanding and evolution acceptance, an
   optimal method to improve understanding of genetics and evolution, as
   well as to improve evolution acceptance, may be to concentrate more
   effort into the teaching of the genetic concepts that underpin the
   mechanisms of evolutionary change.

Why might order matter?

   The above results fit within the broader context of notions that order
   is important for learning, be that student learning or artificial
   intelligence learning [57], and that the importance of such effects is
   underappreciated [57], not least because of the dearth of empirical
   evidence [57]. Our study design was not focused on understanding why
   the order might help so much as whether the order helps. Nonetheless,
   we can speculate. The ordering effects could be owing to conceptual
   priming [58], the notion that exposure to one concept makes one more or
   less receptive to a subsequent stimulus, although there may well be
   more than 1 underlying mechanism [59]. This then would be different
   from the rationale as to why the ordering of the use of analogy works,
   as this appears rather to be owing to analogical mapping [60], not
   conceptual priming. While our motivation for this project was largely
   inspired by the possibility of conceptual priming, a possibly
   synergistic explanation might be that, as nearly all of the material
   needed to understand allele frequency change is front loaded under the
   banner of genetics and not under the banner of evolution, the core
   foundational concepts were absorbed in a context that mitigates
   belief-associated cognitive biases (e.g., confirmation bias [61]). That
   is to say, the foundational concepts (DNA, mutation, inheritance,
   alleles) are uncontroversial and should be easily absorbed when
   presented under the umbrella of genetics. Once accepted, the
   cognititive dissonance [62] associated with processing information
   under the banner “evolution” might be considerably lessened, as the
   student has only one bit of information to process—alleles can change
   frequency—which, additionally, follows as a logical consequence
   (conceptual priming) of the material absorbed without confirmation
   bias. Consistent with this, we found in qualitative data numerous
   examples of students anxious about learning evolution because of their
   religious beliefs, indicative of possible cognitive dissonance.

   If the second explanation is correct, it might be best to teach
   material that is evolution under the banner “genetics” or “population
   genetics.” This “evolution by stealth” strategy could be tested by
   presenting the same “genetics first, evolution second” material under
   different banners. In the control, the students would be told
   explicitly that they are now switching to studying “evolution” and in
   the second, they would be told explicitly that they are now switching
   to studying “population genetics.” If the result is owing to any of the
   above cognitive biases (rather than something peculiar about the
   classroom situation), then the same “genetics first” intervention may
   well be profitable if employed at different educational levels (e.g.,
   first year university level) and also in public engagement.

Why is evolution understanding and acceptance weakly coupled?

   Teaching evolution and genetics results in a significant increase in
   evolution acceptance, regardless of teaching order. While the “genetics
   first” option had demonstrable effects on evolution understanding, the
   same was not true for evolution acceptance. This could be explained (in
   statistical terms) as a consequence of a decoupling of evolutionary
   knowledge from acceptance of evolution. After partial correlation
   control, we report a correlation between evolution understanding and
   evolution acceptance of R = 0.18, making R^2 just ~3% (Table 2). That
   is to say, variation in one parameter explains only 3% of the variation
   in the other. As a consequence, assuming a causal arrow between
   understanding and acceptance, a small but detectable increase in
   evolution understanding owing to teaching order is expected to have, at
   most, a miniscule effect on increased evolution acceptance, so
   miniscule as to be beyond the resolution of this study, despite its
   relatively large sample sizes.

   Our qualitative analysis suggests coherent reasons for the decoupling
   of evolution understanding, not least of which is what might be
   considered “authority.” For students of a religious background, this
   appeared to be of some importance, as might be expected given the prior
   literature on religious-based impediments to acceptance of evolution in
   numerous contexts. Anecdotally, it appears that simple statements
   concerning the acceptance of evolution by key religious authority
   figures, prior to teaching, may enable some students to approach
   evolution as they would any other science. However, the data here are
   anecdotal.

   The dislocation between acceptance and understanding also underscores
   the need to consider acceptance and understanding/knowledge as 2
   distinct parameters. In addition, in this context we note that although
   the terms knowledge and understanding have been used synonymously,
   there is a difference. While students might have knowledge of a topic,
   they may not really understand it. Perhaps a better distinction between
   these terms would provide more insight into relationships with
   acceptance. Discussions with students would suggest that they know
   evidence for evolution exists, yet few are able to describe any of this
   evidence in any detail or even give examples. They appear to have
   limited understanding of evidence. However, these students are still
   accepting of evolution. This also leads to the question, what is known?
   Are there particular areas of genetics or evolution knowledge that
   provoke evolution acceptance? Or, indeed, are there specific aspects of
   genetics knowledge that enrich evolution knowledge?

Are we teaching foundation classes appropriately?

   While teaching genetics first was the only order in which the
   foundation students improved understanding of evolution, one possible
   source of concern in our results is the consistency with which teaching
   improves scores for higher-ability students more than it does for
   foundation-ability students. In some cases, we see that teaching
   possibly has a negative impact on foundation-ability students. Some of
   the latter may be owing to stochastic fluctuation and is, thus, not of
   concern. We also cannot fully eliminate the possibility of the bored
   student. However, the greater response of the high-ability students
   cannot be easily dismissed as, if anything, we expect there to be a
   “ceiling effect” of the questionnaire, in which those that demonstrate
   high acceptance or knowledge prior to teaching cannot increase all that
   much (put differently, you can’t score more than 100%).

   One hypothesis to address these observations is that, despite the fact
   that “genetics first” was the only strategy that led to improvements of
   evolution understanding for the foundation-ability group, what works
   for the teaching of high-ability students may not be optimal for
   foundation students. This in turns suggests the possibility of
   tailoring teaching to ability, as, for example, is done in mathematics.
   Whether this means a simple intervention such as slower teaching (and
   slower more reinforced introduction of new concepts), or different
   approaches to the teaching, will require considerable further analysis,
   far beyond the scope of the current analysis. Evident hypotheses for
   further scrutiny include the possibility that higher-ability students
   tend to have higher logical reasoning skills. Alternatively, might
   higher-ability students be any more or less likely to have alternative
   prior beliefs, compared to lower-ability students?

Caveats

   Given the imperfect nature of school-level interventions, our study
   naturally comes with multiple caveats. Our strategy was to randomise
   ordering of teaching between teachers and to have enough teachers in
   each group as to discount any effect of the individual teacher, cohort
   or class. That is to say, had we just employed 2 classes we would not
   have been able to say if any effect was owing to the ordering rather
   than owing to the teacher. The premise of our design was to assume that
   with enough different teachers and classes, for every exceptional
   teacher teaching evolution first, there would be an equally exceptional
   one teaching genetics first. It remains a possibility that the
   genetics-first effect was owing to especially good teachers being, by
   chance, randomised into the genetics first class. Such is the problem
   of all randomisations. However, we also see the genetics-first effects
   in both ability partitions (when analysed at the student level). If the
   core result were a failure of randomisation, it is a failure that has
   occurred in both independent subgroups. Moreover, we see no evidence
   for underdispersion, suggesting that teacher effects are not an
   important issue.

   What we can be more confident about is that there exists no bias owing
   to teachers teaching in their preferred and practiced manner, as
   teachers didn’t get to select the order that they might teach in
   (teaching order was handed down from the head of sciences or biology in
   each school). Those teachers that switched order had no lesser impact
   on change scores than those that didn’t. Some schools couldn’t,
   however, be properly randomised, because they were constrained as to
   order (e.g., they needed more advanced warning to buy in resources).
   However, there appear to be as many who taught evolution first as
   taught genetics first, so we don’t expect this to be a major issue.
   Nonetheless, this constraint means that our trial isn’t of the strict
   standards of medical randomised control trials in which there are no
   constraints as to which treatment each recipient is exposed to.
   Moreover, unlike a medical trial in which there is a treatment and a
   control, this study permits no control, as it would be unethical to not
   teach students material they would need in exams. By contrast, as the
   teachers had to teach the material anyway, we have no evidence of
   teacher drop out after ordering was chosen (in drug trials, patients
   can show biased profiles of dropout). There are multiple other issues
   of sampling (e.g., we invited all schools within a given area, but the
   responding schools may be a biased subset) that also are less than
   optimal, but unavoidable as well. We consider these and other details
   of the implementation of the experimental design in S1 Text.

Methods

Ethical considerations and data protection

   The project was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of
   Biology and Biochemistry of the University of Bath. Ethical guidelines
   as prescribed by The British Educational Research Education [63] have
   been followed. Particular consideration has been taken when working
   with school students, and approaches that place any undue burden on
   participants have been avoided. Research through questionnaires and
   focus groups has taken place within students’ schools and have involved
   students’ usual science teachers so as to minimise undue intrusion.
   Additional information including that on consent forms can be found in
   the supplementary materials (method for obtaining consent to fill
   questionnaires: S2 Text; questionnaire consent form: S3 Text; method
   for group consent: S4 Text; focus group permission form: S5 Text; focus
   group consent form: S6 Text).

Statement of hypothesis

   We consider 3 hypotheses:

   The null hypothesis (HO): there is no difference in terms of student
   response between the genetics-then-evolution and the
   evolution-then-genetics sequences.

   The positive hypothesis (H+): there is an advantage in terms of student
   response for genetics-then-evolution sequence over
   evolution-then-genetics sequence.

   The negative hypothesis (H−): there is an advantage in terms of student
   response for evolution-then-genetics over genetics-then-evolution
   sequence.

   Student response we define in 3 dimensions: understanding of evolution,
   understanding of genetics, and acceptance of evolution. In terms of the
   student response regarding genetics understanding, we had no prior
   supposition that order would affect its understanding and so there is
   no directionality in the test of deviation from null. Effect sizes are
   expressed as percent difference in increments in scores between
   treatments. Our design may be considered a revised version of a
   crossover design [56].

Statement of intent and design

   In trials of this nature, one might suspect that when the test is done,
   a significant effect of any variety is searched for and a story told
   about the significant effect. In this context, we wish to state that
   the study design and intent were lodged with the funders, the Evolution
   Education Trust in March 2011, the project starting several months
   after. The project title was “The teaching of evolution and genetics:
   an investigation into the place of knowledge about genetics in
   accepting the theory of evolution by natural selection.”

   The aim of the project was stipulated thus:

   “The structure of the design of the experiment controls for the
   material presented and allows rigorous evaluation of the hypothesis
   that ‘front-loading’ the genetics component makes a difference. By
   comparing the understanding of evolution and genetics before and after
   the presentation of the packages, we shall be able to determine whether
   the order of presentation of the genetics-related information has an
   effect on the probability that a student has improved understanding.”

   The full statement of design is available from the funders by
   contacting the director: Michael Magnay, Church House, Marston St
   Lawrence, Banbury, Oxon, OX17 2DA, United Kingdom.

Modifications after pilot

   The experimental design permitted a pilot study and initial
   consultation with teachers. From this, we chose to a) allow teachers to
   teach material as they preferred in a manner specific to their exam
   board (rather than obliging them to teach a preprepared package) and b)
   to maximize the sample size within the limit of time available. The
   former option was chosen, as it became clear that teachers would not
   adopt a significant change to their teaching practice and were the
   project to realise an order effect (in either direction), then its
   implementation would be simpler if no change to teaching material was
   required. Thus, we do not control for material presented.

   In addition, we chose to nest the study in a survey of survey of
   understanding of 14–16-year-old UK school childrens’ understanding and
   acceptance of evolution prior to any teaching (as here reported). For
   this, samples sizes in the thousands are the norm, and this informed
   the choice to maximize. As a priori, the students have to be taught
   both streams (genetics and evolution) and no information was available
   to say if either might be better, we presumed no harm. Thus, no power
   calculation was performed. For considerations of the ideal and
   constraints on design and mode of randomisation, please consult S1
   Text. Randomisation was left to heads of science or biology, and no
   teacher was permitted to choose their order. Not all schools could
   alter order (e.g., because they to have to order in supplies for
   teaching particular lessons), so this project falls short of a full
   randomisation.

Student questionnaire

   Quantitative data were collected through a student questionnaire to
   determine acceptance of evolution and understanding of genetics and
   evolution. This was devised for GCSE-level students (14–16-year-olds)
   who study evolution and genetics as part of their science GCSE science
   course. An advantage of analysis of this age group is that order
   effects may well be most easily detected if there has been little or no
   priming. While primary school children in the UK are presently expected
   to be taught basic genetics and evolution on the national curriculum,
   this is a recent introduction and the cohort we analysed did not have
   this exposure. Indeed, this academic stage was chosen as it is
   currently the first, and perhaps only, period at which students have to
   learn about evolution. This cohort is not self-selecting in the way
   that a higher academic stage might be. For example, students aged from
   16–18 and studying for a Biology A-Level qualification will already
   have achieved a reasonable standard of academic achievement in science
   to enrol in this, and presumably have an interest for biology, or would
   not have chosen to study the subject further. Therefore, in choosing to
   study GCSE-level students, this research has involved a wide variety of
   students, in terms of academic ability and interest in evolution and
   science.

   Where possible, the student questionnaire was used at 3 times:
     * Pretest—prior to learning both genetics and evolution;
     * Post-test—immediately after learning of both topics;
     * Retention test—approximately 3 to 6 months after the teaching of
       the topics (but not coinciding with any revision or examination of
       topics).

   Most schools continued to teach these topics as normal, with existing
   variation, such as topic order, being comparative between classes
   without further intervention. However, some schools were also asked to
   make changes to their normal teaching, such as to change the order in
   which evolution and genetics were taught, and/or to include an activity
   which linked the 2 topics. Due to the time constraints of teaching exam
   specifications and limited flexibility within some school schemes of
   work, there was no pressure placed on teachers to change their normal
   teaching sequence or include different resources.

   The questionnaire consists of 25 questions: 13 focus on acceptance of
   evolution (Section A), 6 on genetics knowledge (Section B), and 6 on
   evolution knowledge (Section C). None of the questions involve extended
   writing and are all variations of the multiple-choice question. These
   types of questions were chosen for their practicalities: to aid student
   completion time, to avoid instances of not being able to understand
   transcriptions, to allow for quantitative analysis of data, and that
   this method is commonly used in similar studies (e.g., [49]).

   At all stages of the questionnaire development, including a pilot
   study, evolution and education experts were consulted from the
   University of Bath along with practising teachers. The questionnaire
   was designed with time constraints in mind: teachers consulted during
   its development were insistent that the questionnaire must be short
   enough so that its completion would not considerably reduce their
   lesson time. Ten to 15 minutes was considered an appropriate length.
   The final questionnaires are presented in S7 Text.

Evolution acceptance

   Section A assesses students’ opinions towards evolution and consists of
   13 Likert Scale items. These were based largely on the Measure of
   Acceptance of the Theory of Evolution (MATE), which was developed to
   assess biology teachers’ acceptance of evolution [64] and later,
   undergraduate students’ acceptance of evolution [65]. The original MATE
   instrument consists of 20 items spread disproportionately across 6
   subsections of evolutionary concepts or aspects. It was decided that
   this was too long for school students. Appropriate questions were
   chosen based on their relevance to these different aspects of evolution
   and their accessibility to school-aged students. Given that the MATE
   has been developed and tested predominately on teachers and
   undergraduate students (e.g., [49,66]), some modifications to the
   language used were needed. Where necessary, statements were reworded to
   make them more understandable. Two items were also based on Lovely and
   Konderick’s study [67] into undergraduate opinions of evolution. This
   section was found to be reliable through internal consistency checks
   (alpha 0.82, G6 0.83).

Acceptance categorisation

   Student acceptance is categorised based on acceptance scores. Scores
   for individual items are measured on a scale of 1 to 5, corresponding
   to “very high acceptance,” “high acceptance,” “undecided,” “low
   acceptance,” or “very low acceptance” of evolution. Students receive a
   total score of between 13 and 65 (a higher score represents a higher
   acceptance of evolution). The acceptance categories referred to here
   are an amalgamation of the 2 “high” and “low” acceptance categories
   (“undecided” remains unchanged) as detailed in Table 5. This is based
   on work by Nadelson and Sinatra [68] to describe MATE categories (after
   [69]).

Genetics knowledge

   Section B consists of 6 questions which focus on knowledge of genetics.
   This includes variations on questions from recent GCSE exams,
   questionnaires used in the Genetics Literacy Assessment Instrument
   (GLAI) for undergraduates [70], and questions from [71] in their study
   of school students’ understanding of genetics. Two of these questions
   involve choosing or ordering key words from lists provided, and one
   question involves ticking boxes. These types of questions were chosen
   to gain greater insight into students’ ideas on living organisms and
   genetics and to add variety to the questionnaire for students.

Evolution knowledge

   Section C focuses on evolution knowledge and consists of 6 questions.
   This section includes a variety of different aspects of evolution,
   including natural selection and geological time. Most of these were
   variations of questions used by Rutledge and Warden [49] in their
   research into acceptance and understanding of evolution among high
   school biology teachers. Additionally, a number of questions were
   devised with the assistance of evolution experts. Each question was
   scored equally with a section total out of 6.

Data overview

   Table 6 gives an overview of responses collected from the student
   questionnaire. These were collected from a total of 78 classes within
   23 different schools between September 2012 and September 2015. The
   data collection was terminated in order to enable analysis of results
   within the funding period. In total, 1,886 students completed the
   questionnaire at least once. Table 7 shows the numbers of students
   associated with key variables to be investigated, namely ability and
   topic order. Although 3,572 questionnaires have been received in total,
   there is a large amount of variation in the number of pre-, post-, and
   retention tests completed, as can be seen in Table 6. Individual
   students have been omitted from certain analyses, e.g., those comparing
   pre- and post-test, where students were absent at the time one of these
   questionnaires was completed. Data have been used where possible, as
   there is still value in students’ responses at a single point in time,
   even if it has not been possible to compare paired data longitudinally.
   Sample sizes therefore differ considerably for different analyses.

Focus groups

   Focus groups were designed to better understand the responses found in
   the student questionnaires, i.e., why students were or were not
   accepting of evolution; how these views related to knowledge of
   evolution; how these related to knowledge of genetics; and what other
   factors are important. Seventy-six students were involved in 16 focus
   groups. These students were from 10 different schools. The largest
   focus groups contained 7 students and the smallest, 2. All students
   were from groups identified as “higher-ability,” with most students
   being from among the top sets in each school. The majority of students
   were in Years 9, 10, and 11 and studying towards their GCSE
   examinations. Six students were in Year 12 and studying for A-Level
   exams. Most focus groups comprised students of the same age and from
   the same class, however there were 3 groups which contained a mixture
   of ages and classes.

Background information

   A mixture of state, faith, and independent schools have been involved
   in this project. All schools are from the South of England and Mid and
   South Wales. All are English language schools. Schools included
   students from socially and economically diverse communities, including
   rural, suburban, and inner city. A number of schools are single-sex.
   Although data were not collected specifically on student demographics,
   a wide range of ethnic backgrounds and faiths were represented.
   Background data on schools have been collected from inspection
   (OFSTED/ESTYN) reports, school websites, and from meetings with
   teachers. These can be found in the S1 Data and S1 Text.

Statistics

   All statistics were conducted in R, via purpose-written Tcl scripts or
   in JMP. No change in score data was normally distributed (Shapiro test
   p < 10^−16 in all cases), and we were unable to find a transform to be
   more normal than the raw data. Thus, we largely employ nonparametric
   analyses. However, to confirm some results, we additionally performed
   some parametric tests under the presumption that parametric tests are
   robust to some degree of deviation from normality (the raw data tends
   to be slightly skewed). All such analyses come with the inevitable
   caveats. Z refers to Wilcoxon signed-rank test and compares pre- and
   post-test scores for the paired data (i.e., individual students who
   took the questionnaire twice). W refers to Mann Whitney U test and
   compares different groups of students (i.e., higher- compared to
   foundation-ability). Internal consistency was evaluated using
   Cronbach’s alpha. Correlations were nonparametric Spearman
   correlations.

   To determine whether a correlation between x and y is significantly
   stronger or weaker than the correlation between z and y, we performed a
   nonparametric Monte Carlo simulation. We start by employing only those
   instances where for any given student, x, y, and z can all be
   calculated (i.e., students who did all pre- and all post-tests). We
   then calculated the 2 Spearman correlations and asked about the
   difference in the Spearman rank coefficient. We then randomised the
   vector y, and considered for each randomised version the correlation
   between x and randomised y and z and randomized y. We again considered
   the modular difference in Spearman rho value for the correlation of
   these 2 individually against variable y (the mean difference in the
   simulants is zero). Repeating the simulation 10,000 times, we asked how
   often the modular difference was as great or greater than that observed
   in the real data. As we employed modular data, the test is 2-tailed.
   The type 1 error rate is then given by p = (n + 1)/(m + 1), where n is
   the number of randomizations in which the randomised dispersion is as
   extreme or more extreme than that observed in the real data and m the
   number of simulations.

   Significance is taken at alpha <0.05. The 3 variables (change in
   evolution acceptance, change in genetics understanding, and change in
   evolution understanding) we consider to be 3 discrete hypotheses and
   thus perform no multitest correction to allow for this dimension of
   multiplicity. However, when stratified by ability, it is reasonable to
   apply a correction to the 2 partitions, thus if p < 0.05/2 is not
   achieved from the raw statistic, we note that the result is not robust
   to multitest correction.

   We declare that statistical analysis was performed on the data at the
   end of the trial and the trial was not extended to try and “find a
   result.”

   Item nonresponse levels were low. We considered alternative means to
   handle nonresponse, but as the numbers are so low, they make no
   difference to results (S1 Text). All raw data can be found in S1 and S2
   Data. S1 Data present the information at a class level. S2 Data
   presents the score data against the individual (anonymised) student.
   Note that the class id is the first digits of the student id.
