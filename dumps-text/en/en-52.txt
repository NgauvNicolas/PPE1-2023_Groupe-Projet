How could evolution arise from conscious agents?

   Published 4 September 2019

   From Paul Mealing, Melbourne, Australia

   Donald Hoffman claims to have used the theory of evolution by natural
   selection to discover that what we perceive isn’t objective reality,
   but an interface with it (3 August, p 34). He says evolution itself may
   be just an interface projection of deeper dynamics stemming from a
   network of conscious agents. But such agents arrive late in the fossil
   record, so how could evolution arise before they existed?
