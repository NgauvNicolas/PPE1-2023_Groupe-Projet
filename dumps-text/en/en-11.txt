​Evolution

   updated: December 29, 2023

Definition

   Evolution, as related to genomics, refers to the process by which
   living organisms change over time through changes in the genome. Such
   evolutionary changes result from mutations that produce genomic
   variation, giving rise to individuals whose biological functions or
   physical traits are altered. Those individuals who are best at adapting
   to their surroundings leave behind more offspring than less
   well-adapted individuals. Thus, over successive generations (in some
   cases spanning millions of years), one species may evolve to take on
   divergent functions or physical characteristics or may even evolve into
   a different species.

Narration

   Evolution. Studying the science of evolution can completely transform
   our understanding of the subject of history. Evolution is, in a way,
   the history of all living organisms on Earth. And the timescale for
   appreciating that history is just so many orders of magnitude greater
   than what we can understand from the study of human history alone. It's
   actually humbling to situate human experience against that backdrop of
   millions of years of gradual change to the genome, millions of years of
   activity that took place on Earth prior to humans coming onto the
   scene.
