Spiralling school of jack fish image takes photography prize

   THIS stunning selection of images showcases the world’s biodiversity to
   highlight the importance of protecting it. The pictures represent some
   of the winners and runners-up of this year’s BMC Ecology and Evolution
   photography competition, which invited researchers to submit images
   that they think encapsulate the diversity of animals and plants.

   The main image is the overall winner, taken by coral reef ecologist
   Kristen Brown. She captured this school of jack fish at Heron Island in
   Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, and describes the scene as a metaphor
   for the climate change, pollution and overfishing crisis spiralling out
   of control in and around the world’s oceans.

   The winning image in the Population Ecology category by evolutionary
   biologist Roberto García-Roa shows soldier termites using an abandoned
   rope to migrate across a forest in Malaysia.

   Kseniya Vereshchagina, an ecologist who studies Lake Baikal in Siberia,
   was the overall runner-up for her image of Eulimnogammarus verrucosus
   with a fluffy parasitic infection. Heavy industry and tourism in the
   lake weakens the immunity of these crustaceans, making them more
   susceptible to such things.

   The winning image in the Behavioural Ecology category was also taken by
   García-Roa, and shows a wasp capturing a spider on the wall of a
   biological station in Ecuador.
