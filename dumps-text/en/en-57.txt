    Zoosystematics and Evolution is an international, peer-reviewed life
   science journal devoted to the diversity, systematics and evolution of
   all animal groups, except for insects. It publishes original research
   and review articles at all taxonomic levels. Its scope encompasses
   primary information from collection-related research, taxonomic
   descriptions and discoveries, revisions, annotated type catalogues,
   relevant aspects of the history of science, and contributions on new
   methods and principles of taxonomy and systematics. Articles whose main
   topic is ecology, functional anatomy, physiology, or ethology are only
   acceptable when of clear systematic or evolutionary relevance and
   perspective. Studies on insects should be submitted to the sister
   journal of ZSE, Deutsche Entomologische Zeitschrift (DEZ).
