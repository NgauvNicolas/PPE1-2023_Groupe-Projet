Perhaps evolution has squared that circle (2)

   Published 13 January 2021

   From Ian Flitcroft, Dublin, Ireland

   The arguments cited against the evolution of wheels in living things
   include the problem of the environment not being smooth and the
   challenge of supplying blood to a biological wheel.

   Maybe there are exceptions. Tumbleweed lacks blood, but has evolved a
   rolling solution that is perfectly suited to its flat, desert
   environment. Its “wheeled” design has a clear advantage, allowing
   distribution of the plant and its seeds over a wide area.

   It is sometimes suggested that we are the only creature to have
   invented the wheel. I think dung beetles may have beaten us by millions
   of years, “inventing” a way to get collections of dung larger than
   themselves uphill: rolling them.
