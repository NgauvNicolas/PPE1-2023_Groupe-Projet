Perhaps evolution has squared that circle (1)

   Published 13 January 2021

   From Rachel Mckeown, Aberfan, Mid Glamorgan, UK

   You wonder why animals haven’t evolved wheels (19/26 December 2020, p
   50). It is worth noting that the body of an organism isn’t the boundary
   of its phenotype.

   Richard Dawkins introduced the “extended phenotype” concept in which a
   cascade of causality ultimately stemming from genes can eventually lead
   to non-biological products, examples being architectures like beaver
   dams. Could the wheel similarly be considered an extended phenotype of
   humans, constructed once evolution had invented sufficiently advanced
   intelligence?

   Non-biological materials don’t face the same inherent limits as living
   tissue, such as the blood supply requirement. When phenotypes are
   expanded according to Dawkins’s framework, the design book for
   evolution to explore could massively expand.
