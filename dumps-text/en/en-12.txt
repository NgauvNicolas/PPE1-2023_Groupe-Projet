Origin of evolution

   ^1
   First recorded in 1615–25; from Latin ēvolūtiōn- (stem of ēvolūtiō )
   “an unrolling, opening,” equivalent to ēvolūt(us) past participle of
   ēvolere “to roll out or away” + -iōn-; see evolute,-ion

word story For evolution

   Evolution comes from Latin ēvolūtiō (stem ēvolūtiōn- ) “unrolling a
   papyrus scroll, reading through (an author's words or a book),” a
   derivative of the verb ēvolvere “to roll out or away, unroll (a papyrus
   scroll), uncover, unwrap, unfold by using the intellect.”
   The earliest English meaning of evolution, “a movement or series of
   movements of troops or ships into battle formation,” dates from the
   early 17th century. The modern, biological sense “change in the gene
   pool of a population from generation to generation by mutation, natural
   selection, and genetic drift,” first appears in 1832 in the works of
   British geologist Charles Lyell in a discussion of some invertebrate
   sea creatures.
   Charles Darwin did not use the word evolution at all in his first
   edition of On the Origin of Species (1859), although he did use the
   verb evolved at the very end of the book. Darwin preferred descent with
   modification, because the idea of progress had no place in his theory
   or work. It was his contemporary Herbert Spencer who, embracing
   Darwin's work, popularized evolution in its biological sense and also
   extended the word into ethics, philosophy, and sociology.

     __________________________________________________________________

    1. The process by which species of organisms arise from earlier life
       forms and undergo change over time through natural selection. The
       modern understanding of the origins of species is based on the
       theories of Charles Darwin combined with a modern knowledge of
       genetics based on the work of Gregor Mendel. Darwin observed there
       is a certain amount of variation of traits or characteristics among
       the different individuals belonging to a population. Some of these
       traits confer fitness-they allow the individual organism that
       possesses them to survive in their environment better than other
       individuals who do not possess them and to leave more offspring.
       The offspring then inherit the beneficial traits, and over time the
       adaptive trait spreads through the population. In twentieth
       century, the development of the the science of genetics helped
       explain the origin of the variation of the traits between
       individual organisms and the way in which they are passed from
       generation to generation. This basic model of evolution has since
       been further refined, and the role of genetic drift and sexual
       selection in the evolution of populations has been recognized. See
       also natural selection sexual selection. See Notes at adaptation
       Darwin.
    2. A process of development and change from one state to another, as
       of the universe in its development through time.

a closer look

   Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection assumed that tiny
   adaptations occur in organisms constantly over millions of years.
   Gradually, a new species develops that is distinct from its ancestors.
   In the 1970s, however, biologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould
   proposed that evolution by natural selection may not have been such a
   smooth and consistent process. Based on fossils from around the world
   that showed the abrupt appearance of new species, Eldredge and Gould
   suggested that evolution is better described through punctuated
   equilibrium. That is, for long periods of time species remain virtually
   unchanged, not even gradually adapting. They are in equilibrium, in
   balance with the environment. But when confronted with environmental
   challenges-sudden climate change, for example-organisms adapt quite
   quickly, perhaps in only a few thousand years. These active periods are
   punctuations, after which a new equilibrium exists and species remain
   stable until the next punctuation.

Cultural definitions for evolution

   evolution
     __________________________________________________________________

   A theory first proposed in the nineteenth century by Charles Darwin,
   according to which the Earth's species have changed and diversified
   through time under the influence of natural selection. Life on Earth is
   thought to have evolved in three stages. First came chemical evolution,
   in which organic molecules (see also organic molecule) were formed.
   This was followed by the development of single cells capable of
   reproducing themselves. This stage led to the development of complex
   organisms capable of sexual reproduction. Evolution is generally
   accepted as fact by scientists today, although debates continue over
   the precise mechanisms involved in the process. (See mutation,
   punctuated equilibrium, and creation science.)

Notes for evolution

   The first cell is thought to have been formed when the Earth was less
   than a billion years old.
