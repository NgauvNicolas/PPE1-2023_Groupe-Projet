The mighty coast redwoods are born to change. But can they evolve fast enough
to survive climate warming?

   by Daniel Lewis, Los Angeles Times

   Coast redwoods—enormous, spectacular trees, some reaching nearly 400
   feet, the tallest plants on the planet—thrive mostly in a narrow strip
   of land in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Most of them
   grow from southern Oregon down into Northern California, snugged up
   against the rugged Pacific coast.

   They have grown by slowly responding to moisture and rich alluvial soil
   over millenniums, combined with a genetic payload that pushes them to
   the upper limits of tree height. They are at risk—down to perhaps
   70,000 individuals, falling from at least a half-million trees before
   humans arrived, but that's not a new story, for we are all at risk.

   Redwoods, like all trees, are engineered marvels. People don't tend to
   think of natural things as "structures," leaving that term to stand in
   for buildings, bridges, and dams. But although trees were not built by
   humans, they didn't just happen.

   They have come into their own through the inexorably turning wheels of
   natural selection and evolution, responding to environmental pressures,
   genetic drift, and mutation (they even have two kinds of leaves that
   help the trees adapt to both wet and dry conditions). They are born to
   change, just as humans are born to change.

   Evolution is usually a very slow process, although sometimes it's
   surprisingly quick. New, intense pressures of a warming and changing
   climate are speeding things up and forcing researchers and
   horticulturists to examine approaches to climate change resilience and
   technologies like geographic information systems.

   Of course, there are differences between man-made edifices and trees. A
   structure or building typically is a sort of island unto itself,
   separate from its neighbors; in contrast, the coast redwood is an
   ecosystem with enormously broad consequences for other life forms.
   [INS: :INS]

   Life is folded in and among the redwoods, below and within and about
   them. The trees are integrators, bringing together many life forms.
   Some of these life forms rely on the tree, others on occupants in and
   around the tree.

   The coast redwood hosts so many different ecological interactions that
   it's faintly ridiculous. Consider the wandering salamander, which
   usually spends its entire life high in the canopy, but sometimes must
   jump out to escape predators. Without wings or gliding, it falls from a
   great height only to land perfectly unharmed on the ground.

   It took scientists dropping these creatures into a wind tunnel and
   filming them with high-speed cameras to understand why they didn't end
   up as a wet splat on the forest floor. As it turns out, the
   salamander's flattened body shape and large feet with long toes create
   just enough drag and balance for a soft landing.

   Redwoods are so large that one reportedly was found to house a Sitka
   spruce, 8 feet tall, growing far off the ground within the larger tree.
   Redwoods also have served for millenniums as nesting habitat for huge
   California condors, with wingspans of nearly 10 feet.

   There's also a place for the tiny, living side by side with all of the
   largeness tucked in the complex, secret interstices of these trees.
   Nestled into extensive mats of ferns that grow high up in redwood
   canopies, researchers find aquatic crustaceans called copepods that
   normally would live in larger bodies of water. No one knows how they
   got into the trees, but the fern mats trap enormous quantities of
   moisture from rain and fog, creating wetlands in the sky.

   Yet even species as enduring as coast redwoods are affected by climate
   change. Diminished moisture stresses the trees, making them grow with
   less vigor. New fire dangers put them at risk, and more frequent floods
   erode the big trees' footing. But redwoods also are adapting.

   A 2018 survey of nine large redwood trees found a total of 137 species
   of lichen growing on the trees, including several that were new to
   science. One was Xylopsora canopeorum, whose specific name celebrates
   the canopy where it was discovered.

   This lichen seems to be unique to the warmer and drier forests in
   California's Sonoma and Santa Cruz counties, in the southern part of
   the coast redwoods' range. This is an exciting finding, for it provides
   evidence that new forms of life—ecosystem partners—may be evolving in
   sync with trees that are also evolving in the face of climate change.

   A pair of redwoods grow just outside my office at the Huntington in San
   Marino, which is some 700 miles south of the coast redwood's usual
   range. I've resisted giving names to this duo, although many giant
   redwoods have monikers like Adventure, Brutus, Nugget, Paradox, and
   Atlas—most named by the scientists who first quantified their extreme
   heights.

   The redwoods outside my window are perhaps 100 feet tall—puny by
   comparison to their northern brethren. But they are healthy and will
   continue to be shaped by their immediate environments. They've traveled
   far to get here, planted more than a half-century ago by an earlier
   generation of horticulturalists, and they're thriving in their new
   home. We should all be so lucky.
