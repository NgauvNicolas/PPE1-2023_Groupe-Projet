   Country Coordinating Mechanisms are core to the Global Fund’s
   contribution to health governance to help end HIV, tuberculosis and
   malaria while investing in resilient and sustainable systems for
   health. The CCM Evolution Strategic Initiative is a catalytic
   opportunity to enhance the way our partnership works in countries and
   regions. The approach and methodology build from a pilot phase in
   2018-2019.

Objectives

   Transition
   Regional coordination

   The objective of CCM Evolution is to equip CCMs to facilitate inclusive
   oversight and meaningful engagement in alignment with national
   structures for sustained health governance. As tested in the pilot,
   this involves increased focus on four core responsibilities:
     * Oversight: Active oversight of existing and emerging investments
     * Engagement: Meaningful, inclusive and active participation of key
       stakeholders
     * Positioning: Working within national structures and existing
       emerging platforms to increase efficiency of health investments
     * Operations: CCM Secretariats’ core functions (including the code of
       conduct), enabling and sustaining health governance

Anticipated Results

   The anticipated results are to change business as usual, leveraging the
   opportunity of the strategic initiative to enhance CCMs, streamline
   processes and invest in results – strengthening governance for existing
   and emerging health challenges.

Implementation

   Implementation is being rolled out in waves through 2021. Steps,
   timelines and more information are in our overview materials:

Pilot

   The CCM Evolution started in 2018 with a pilot phase in 18 countries.
   The pilot focused on sustainably strengthening CCM performance in four
   areas: overseeing grants, ensuring linkages with national structures,
   engaging key stakeholders and strengthening how CCMs function. The
   results and lessons learned from the pilot were presented to the Global
   Fund Board and committees and serve as the foundation for the global
   implementation of CCM Evolution. In 2019 the Board approved a US$15
   million strategic initiative to support the implementation.
