   Use joints, bones and muscles to build creatures that are only limited
   by your imagination. Watch how the combination of a neural network and
   a genetic algorithm can enable your creatures to "learn" and improve at
   their given tasks all on their own.

   The tasks include running, jumping, climbing and flying. Can you build
   the ultimate creature that is good at all of the tasks?

   For an extensive explanation on how everything works click on the "?"
   button in the editor (I highly recommend everybody to read it). I also
   recently compiled a lot of my answers to common questions in this  FAQ.

   Please be aware that this is more of a sandbox simulator demonstrating
   basic machine learning than a real game. There are no achievements or
   player rewards. Even if a creature of yours reaches 100% fitness, you
   don't win anything except for (hopefully) lots of excitement and joy.

   Here's a video with some great creature designs by KeiraR that you can
   use as inspiration for your own creatures:

   I created a collection of gifs of user created creatures over on my
   website. Do you have a cool creature design that you want to be
   featured? See here for more info.

   Important note: If you want to save your own creatures and
   simulations you have to use the downloadable Mac / Windows / Android /
   iOS versions.
