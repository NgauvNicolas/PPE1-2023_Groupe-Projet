Abstract

   The idea of biological evolution is not accepted by many people around
   the world, with a large disparity amongst countries. Some factors may
   act as obstacles to the acceptance of evolution, such as religion, a
   lack of openness to experience, and not understanding the nature of
   science. Although the strength of the association between evolution
   acceptance and non-scientific factors varies among studies, it is often
   assumed that resistance to evolution is the byproduct of a religious
   background. Some studies are even more specific and try to associate
   the acceptance of evolution with precise religious affiliations. We
   aimed to explore the strength of associations among nationality,
   religion, and the acceptance of evolution by students using multiple
   correspondence analysis (MCA) and statistical tools, with nationwide
   samples from two different countries. Here, we show that wider
   sociocultural factors predict the acceptance of evolution to a higher
   degree than a religious background. We carried out two nationwide data
   collections that allowed us to compare differences in the acceptance of
   evolution in Italy and Brazil by high school students who declare to
   belong to the same religion in the two countries. Roman Catholic
   students showed significant differences between the two countries, and
   the gap between them was wider than between Catholics and non-Catholic
   Christians within Brazil. Our conclusions support those who argue that
   religious affiliation is not the main factor in predicting the level of
   evolution acceptance. The sociocultural environment and the level of
   evolutionary knowledge seem to be more important in this regard. These
   results open up new interpretative perspectives and provide a better
   understanding of attitudes towards evolution.

Introduction

   The acceptance of evolution has been a central topic in evolution
   education in at least the last three decades [1,2]. Researchers have
   examined numerous factors that may act as obstacles to the acceptance
   of evolution, such as religiosity, knowledge of evolutionary theory,
   the understanding of the nature of science, scientific aptitudes, and
   psychological conflicts, among others [3–6]. A major association seems
   to exist among three main factors: the understanding of key biological
   concepts, religious factors, and the understanding of the nature of
   science. However, the data require further investigation.

   A systematic literature review of the current state of research
   regarding students’ and teachers’ acceptance of evolution across Europe
   found that the level of acceptance of evolution in different
   educational settings is ambiguous. The authors argue that similar
   samples and a standardized assessment of the acceptance of evolution
   are necessary for cross-country comparisons [7].

   The use of different instruments to measure evolution acceptance could
   be a cause of conflicting research results. A variety of tests have
   been proposed, including the Measure of Acceptance of the Theory of
   Evolution (MATE), which has been widely used for more than 20 years and
   recently revised [8], the Inventory of Student Evolution Acceptance
   (I-SEA) [9], the Generalized Acceptance of EvolutioN Evaluation (GAENE)
   [10], etc. It should be considered that the studies cited above differ
   in their contexts of comparison in relation to ages, countries, and
   socioeconomic levels, as well as the number of data collected and
   measurement statistics. However, inconsistencies in the results were
   found even in the analysis of the same group with different instruments
   measuring the acceptance of evolution.

   Barnes et al. [6] conducted separate analyses using six different
   evolution acceptance instruments with the same group of students, a
   large sample of around 2,300 university students. The instruments were
   administered in a random order to avoid bias due to differential
   attention and response readiness. The results were surprising and
   showed that different instruments led to different results for the
   measure of evolution acceptance, including conflicting ones. These
   results may also be interpreted as an indication that some instruments
   need methodological revisions in the search for possible distortions
   and biases.

   Additionally, the research findings revealed a complex relationship
   between understanding evolutionary concepts (e.g. natural selection)
   and evolution acceptance [10–13]. The same lack of consensus exists
   when measuring the level of evolution knowledge, given that several
   alternative assessment tools are available and may lead to different
   results [14,15]. A study with secondary school students (aged 14–16) in
   the United Kingdom found that teaching genetics before teaching
   evolution had a significant impact on improving evolution understanding
   but did not result in a significantly increased acceptance of evolution
   [16]. This reflects a weak correlation between the knowledge and
   acceptance of evolution, which also appears to be present in
   undergraduate students. In Chilean students of 15–16 years old, it was
   found that including instruction on the nature of science in the class
   on evolution improved their acceptance significantly [17].

   Kuschmierz et al. [7] identified 56 papers from the period of 2010–2020
   regarding students’ and teachers’ knowledge and acceptance of evolution
   across 29 European countries. However, according to the authors, the
   research findings were hard to compare due to the application of
   different instruments and the assessment of different key concepts. The
   available database was not sufficient to obtain reasonably comparable
   data from European countries. In addition, the ambiguous results of the
   research demonstrate multiple challenges regarding measurement of
   evolution education, such as (a) inadequate definitions of key
   constructs (attitudes, acceptance, knowledge, and understanding are
   often not defined or inconsistently used in publications); (b) the
   application of diverse measurement instruments (different evolution
   acceptance instruments may produce different results, even when applied
   to the same population); (c) the multidimensionality of knowledge about
   evolution (most instruments focus on single evolutionary constructs,
   such as natural selection and related concepts).

   The authors [18] then developed an instrument to measure attitudes and
   understanding across Europe and beyond, called the “Evolution Education
   Questionnaire on Acceptance and Knowledge” (EEQ). The measurement
   instrument was translated into several European languages, in the
   various Romance, Germanic, and Slavic branches, and was recently
   applied to 9200 first-year university students in 26 European countries
   [19].

   This is a recent initiative, and thus, due to a lack of standardized
   assessment procedures in the existing literature, previous results
   should be used with caution when trying to compare countries, as there
   are several limitations, such as sampling biases, etc. [18].

   Religious beliefs are among the factors most investigated as predictors
   to the low acceptance of evolution in several studies, especially among
   some age groups, religious affiliations, and nationalities, mainly
   Christian American students [10,20,21]. Barnes et al. [22] conducted a
   study with 1898 students in eight states of the United States and found
   that 56.5% of students perceived that evolution is atheistic, with a
   higher percentage of Catholic and other Christian students. This
   perception among students may lead to an apparent conflict between
   their personal religious beliefs and evolution [23].

   In addition to Christians, those of the Muslim faith have been
   investigated, although the debate between several religions and
   evolution is more typically addressed in Western contexts [24].
   However, multifactorial models have found that once religiosity and
   other measures are accounted for, the amount of variance in acceptance
   of evolution is greatly reduced [13,25]. Mantelas and Mavrikaki [26]
   examined the acceptance of evolution and its relationship with
   religiosity among Greek university biology students. A rather weak
   correlation was found between the two factors.

   Evolution is controversial among both religious and non-religious
   individuals, and inconsistent views of evolution have been evidenced in
   both groups [24,27]. The picture appears to not be static, as a sample
   of U.S. education professionals with a wide range of religious
   commitments showed a significantly higher level of acceptance than
   previous studies [28]. Moreover, the level of public acceptance of
   evolution has increased in the United States in the last decade, and
   education seems to play a significant role [29]. Thus, in certain
   social contexts, religiosity may be a main component by itself, while
   in others, evolution acceptance may depend on other factors.

   There is a tendency, which cannot be taken as unanimous, that
   associates the belief in any God (deism) as intrinsically
   anti-evolutionist [30]. One can easily remember the several references
   to the "Creator" in the Origin of Species, especially in its second
   edition, showing that this direct link is far more complex than it may
   seem at a first sight. The high heterogeneity of data available and the
   well-known methodological issues around gathering sensitive opinions
   and beliefs do not allow for a narrow focus on the search for one
   isolated variable. However, it has been often assumed that resistance
   to evolution is somehow a byproduct of religious background, especially
   in the United States [22,31].

   Some researchers have focused closely on specific religious groups,
   such as Pentecostal Christians, known for their literal reading of
   sacred texts and strong opposition to evolution [32]. One study was
   carried out in Brazil, where these religious groups have a growing
   influence, and tried to establish a direct correlation between the
   frequency of Pentecostal Christians and the level of rejection of
   evolution between the students of two high schools [33]. A written
   instrument was created, based on a well-known one [8], and 10 students
   were invited for semi-structured interviews [33]. Although no direct
   correlation was found, the author concluded that religious beliefs are
   important elements that shape students’ ideas, possibly introducing
   “constraints that might hinder the understanding of evolutionary
   theory” [33, p. 63].

   Another piece of research developed a survey instrument with a
   nationwide sample of the British population about the general public’s
   views of evolution. As the study had a closer focus on religion, there
   was oversampling of five different religious affiliations: Anglicans
   (or Episcopalians), Catholics, Muslims, Pentecostal Christians, and
   Independent Evangelical Christians. The results showed a strong
   rejection of evolution by Muslims, Pentecostals, and Independent
   Evangelical Christians, contrary to the position of non-religious
   people, Anglicans, and Catholics, who showed high agreement to
   statements about human evolution. The study revealed that the frequency
   of religious service attendance is a large significant predictor of
   evolution rejection among most religious groups [24, p.88]. The general
   conclusion was that religious affiliation and the degree to which
   individuals participate in religious practices affect the acceptance of
   evolution as a valid theory.

   A recent study with a large sample of almost 8000 undergraduate biology
   students in different states of the United States searched for
   correlations between religious affiliation and variables such as the
   acceptance and understanding of evolution. Using a Likert scale
   instrument, they found that Muslim undergraduate students showed
   slightly higher evolution acceptance levels than Protestant students,
   but significantly lower levels than Catholic, Jewish, Buddhist, and
   Hindu students [34].

   However, some researchers have been questioning the common view that
   religious affiliation is the main factor to the acceptance of
   evolution. They argue that it is more likely that people form beliefs
   congruent with their broad cultural identity, which includes but is not
   limited to religious belief [35,36]. However, most articles arguing in
   this direction are case studies and philosophical or legal debates
   about evolution vs creation in the school curricula, mostly in the U.S.
   context [37]. In addition, with few exceptions, such as the reports by
   Miller et al. [2] and Clément [36], most studies have focused on a
   specific culture or country, even if with large samples.

   Our main research question tried to address this complex picture
   considering the same religious affiliation in two different countries
   with deep sociocultural differences. Catholic Christians in Italy and
   Brazil have several similarities, including many family connections
   owing to immigration history. Brazil is the country with the highest
   number of Catholic Christians in the world, and Italy is the hub of
   Roman Catholicism. They follow the same basic regulations from the
   Vatican, which include explicit views on biological evolution and a
   non-literal interpretation of sacred texts. However, there are deep
   sociocultural differences due to many complex factors, including
   education. A survey comprising 192 Brazilian students was carried out
   in Brazil in 1990, which found a great deal of Lamarckian views [38].
   One should also consider that in the last three decades, there has been
   a significant rise in the creationist movement in Brazil [39]. One
   Brazilian state minister declared in 2019 that the Evangelical Church
   should fight against the introduction of the theory of evolution in
   public schools, before her recent nomination [40]. Another member of
   the federal government declared in an open ceremony that Intelligent
   Design (ID) should be introduced in Brazil’s public schools as “a
   counterpoint to the theory of evolution”, assuming that there would be
   a “creationist theory” to be taught in science lessons starting at the
   primary level [41]. Research carried out in Brazil had already showed
   that creationism had a significant influence on young science teachers
   [42].

   Italy is a highly industrialized country within the European Union.
   Research on the public understanding of science has been frequent, with
   nationwide surveys since 2004 [43]. However, specific research on the
   knowledge and acceptance of evolution in Italy was scarce at that time.
   Whereas Italy is included in broader international surveys, it accounts
   only for a few targeted case studies that vary in types of audience and
   goals. Despite the scarce data, researchers indicated that rejection of
   the evolutionary theory is neither widespread nor deeply rooted in
   Italian society [44], which was confirmed by Pew Research Center
   reports. The same source recently confirmed the tendency of the rise of
   the creationist perspective in Brazil within adults, with a
   considerably lower acceptance of evolution by Christians in Brazil
   (51%) than in Italy (74%) [45].

Methodological issues

   Despite the similarities between Italy and Brazil, there is a marked
   difference between the two sociocultural contexts. However, some
   methodological issues should be properly addressed to avoid some
   sources of significant bias in the statistical tools to be used. The
   sample design was an important step, as nationwide samples best
   represent the complexity of the several sociocultural influences. As we
   were targeting the main religious group in both countries (Catholics),
   no oversampling was necessary. Non-Catholic Christians would be part of
   the sample, but no specific conclusions could be drawn considering the
   different religious affiliations within the group.

   Brazil is a country where religious practices are diverse and encompass
   several different belief systems and traditions, which reflect elements
   of European (Catholic and Protestant), African, Oriental, and
   indigenous religions, among others. This diversity has its foundation
   in the colonization process of European immigrants from 1500 onwards,
   African descendants, and local indigenous tribes [46].

   The group of non-Catholic Christians is very heterogeneous, and our
   database aggregated several different affiliations in the two
   countries: Orthodox, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Baptist, Adventist,
   Jehovah’s Witnesses, Assembly of God, Christian Congregation of Brazil,
   International of God’s Grace, World of God’s Power, and the Universal
   Church of the Kingdom of God. Therefore, we consider that the
   comparison between Catholics in the two countries was more suitable for
   this study, as it is a more homogeneous group. The term “evangelical”
   represents the universe of non-Catholic Christians considered by
   Brazilian society as “Brazilian Protestantism”, which is constituted by
   historical Protestants, Pentecostals, and Neo-Pentecostals and led by
   Pentecostals, with a massive dissemination by Neo-Pentecostals. Brazil
   is considered the country with the largest number of Roman Catholics in
   the world. However, this hegemony has been decreasing in recent
   decades, which reveals a changing trend in the religious composition of
   the population [47]. Data from the population census in Brazil point to
   the decline of the Roman Catholic religion and a continuous rise of
   protestant groups in the last decades [48].

   The age level was an essential component for sampling, as elderly
   people tend to be more conservative than young students. Taking
   advantage of an international project focusing on youngsters who were
   beginning high school level in both countries, we prepared separate
   sets of questions about evolution so that we had the very same
   questions answered by students of the same age in the same time frame,
   during the first months of the year 2014. Targeting students at the
   same age level in two different countries allows for closer comparisons
   than multi-age-wide groups. In the next section, a more detailed
   description of the sampling procedures in both countries is given.

   There is an important distinction that we must keep in mind when
   comparing the concepts of belief and acceptance. Differences between
   them have long been discussed in the philosophical literature and the
   specific field of evolution education [25,27,43,49]. The overall
   picture takes belief as a subjective disposition to consider p. simply
   as a premise under the influence of the wide cultural context. A
   well-known distinction is recognized between belief and conjecture
   since the latter is not committed to sensible things and applies even
   to the world of shadows. In this context, it is important to separate
   the notions of belief of classical philosophers, such as Plato and
   Aristotle, from the revision carried out by Thomas Aquinas, who
   considers belief in terms of "thinking with assent" related to faith
   [49]. In our theoretical framework, belief refers to the sensible world
   only, with the reality of things that exist. However, one can take p.
   as a belief, but it does not in itself imply an admission of the
   objective validity of the notion under consideration. Meanwhile, to
   accept p. implies not only recognizing the existence of some objective
   reality but also a further step in terms of judgment, admitting p. as
   valid under some specific circumstances; in short: “acceptance implies
   a commitment to a policy of premising that p.” [50].

   The instrument used in the recent work by Kuschmierz et al. [19],
   ATEVO, relies on eight items with statements about evolution, and
   students show their degree of agreement with each of them [51]. In the
   German context, the acceptance of evolution is defined as a “positive
   attitude” (“positive Einstellung”) towards evolution. In this regard,
   “attitude” (“Einstellung”) is defined as the level of association
   between a term or fact and its subjective evaluation, in terms of
   strength (“Starke”) and/or ability to bind with other terms or ideas
   (“Valenz”). On the opposite side, a “negative attitude” (“negative
   Einstellung”) is seen as “rejection” (“Ablehnung”). However, the result
   of ATEVO test may be the result of very different processes. On the one
   hand, “it remains unknown whether a person answers negatively for most
   items about evolution because he/she has a ‘bad feeling’” (“schlechtes
   Gefühl”) about evolution, in the sense of a preexisting emotional
   refusal to think on the subject. On the other hand, the rejection may
   have been the result of a long reflection leading to a rational
   conclusion that evolution is not plausible [51, p. 12].

   We adopted a clear definition of evolution acceptance despite the
   complexity of the discussion on the subject in different languages,
   taking acceptance as the expression of explicit recognition of the
   objective validity of known scientific statements about evolution under
   absolute anonymity. This definition considers two steps. The first is
   associated with scientific statements about evolution, which must be
   clear and well known, avoiding issues under discussion, for instance,
   about the origin of life. Students must show not only a positive
   attitude towards evolution but also express clearly that a statement
   based on biological evolution is considered a valid premise to
   construct a judgement about the real world.

   The second step refers to objective conditions in which a person may
   admit his/her positive judgment about a certain scientific statement.
   One may know a proposition but to refuse to show public recognition of
   it, or, on the contrary, manifest an opinion different from his/her
   deep feeling due to the suspicion that it may reach a wider audience.
   The perception of secrecy in everyday life is actually a major focus of
   concern worldwide. Strong evidence published in the literature shows
   that anonymity reduces social desirability distortion and increases
   self-disclosure [52,53].

   Therefore, anonymous participation must be guaranteed to every person
   who is responding to questions about religion-related subjects, such as
   biological evolution, especially when surveys are carried out within
   conservative social contexts. Under secrecy, a person may accept a
   proposition as a valid premise for argumentation, making inferences,
   deliberations, etc. as a mental, individual, and innermost act.
   However, this may not happen if there is a perception of the
   possibility of third parties identifying the individual opinion. This
   means, for instance, that phone calls or traceable connections using
   electronic devices such as smartphones could be perceived by
   respondents as possible ways of infringing the inviolability of the
   anonymous character of the individual manifestation.

   In our case, the students answered questions in their school
   environment and were told their answers would be under absolute
   anonymity. Previous analyses of this data bank showed surprisingly high
   mean scores of evolution acceptance within fundamentalist religious
   groups in Italy and Brazil [54]. This was also the case in a previous
   survey using a different methodology, carried out in 2010–11, where
   roughly half of Evangelical high school students in Brazil declared
   under absolute anonymity that their religion was not opposed to
   evolution [55].

   In line with the tantalizing results of the study by Barnes et al. [6]
   already mentioned, our research team proposed a revision to some
   methods adopted in the previous survey. As mentioned before, we were
   carrying out data collection as part of an international project
   focusing on students’ interests and attitudes on science and
   technology, which had started in 2007 [56]. The main research
   instrument was based on Likert scale items but allowed a separated
   section, which we added in both countries. However, we considered a
   different approach for these evolution items, as we were going to
   present students with factual statements that were regarded as right or
   wrong by scientists.

   Items following the Likert attitude data consist of favorable or
   unfavorable statements about an entity, admitting a spectrum of
   responses ranging from strong positive to strong negative answers, with
   a numerical scale from 1 to 5. The resulting data can be analyzed using
   several models that underlie latent variables. However, attitudes as
   well as response styles can affect the result. It is well known that
   numerical comparisons rely on the degree of precision of measures, for
   instance, to estimate the mean height of a group of people. The
   significance of the different statistical analyses are dependent on the
   precision of the instrument used in data collection. Likert scaling is
   used in instruments measuring attitudes, beliefs, and opinions about
   statements, allowing for an expression of moderation of opinion from
   agreement to disagreement. The key is to find ways of calibrating how
   strongly or mildly a statement should be worded. These scales are
   therefore suitable for issues related to open constructs and less
   suitable for scientific claims based on presumed factuality. An item
   likely to produce extreme responses, either full agreement or strong
   disagreement, would do a poor job of discriminating across the full
   spectrum of respondents [57]. Therefore, Likert scales may not be a
   good choice with statements expressing well-known scientific facts. In
   addition, in the case of theories of evolution, factuality is supported
   by the school context in which the questionnaires were filled out. The
   battery of items on evolution was proposed with dichotomous questions,
   given that each of them can have minimal variability.

   When evolution is considered, opinions can be expressed in terms of
   favorable and unfavorable subjective statements, such as “There is a
   significant body of data which supports evolutionary theory” [33],
   “There is strong, reliable evidence to support the theory of evolution”
   [24], or “I think there is reliable evidence to support the theory that
   describes how humans were derived from ancestral primates” [33]. In
   these three examples, latent variables can be inferred in terms of
   personal attitudes, which can range from weak to strong, and grading
   would help to correctly appraise the level of agreement. However,
   well-known factual scientific statements cannot be graded as weak or
   strong scientific facts. For instance “The age of the Earth is at least
   4 billion years” [33] or “I think that humans and apes share an ancient
   ancestor” [15], should be recognized as sound scientific statements (or
   not). We have here a black/white choice, and respondents would be able
   to express their judgment about these scientific statements as true or
   false (or declining to express their opinion). When a well-known
   scientific statement is marked as false, this means an explicit refusal
   to admit it as a valid premise to analyze a certain situation.

   One could argue that the level of admission or rejection can also be
   variable, but we cannot overlook the fact that respondents are aware
   they are invited to make a judgment different from simply recognizing
   the existence of an idea. In other words, respondents know what is
   expected from them. The scientific statement about the age of the
   planet is widely known, both from the scientific and the fundamentalist
   religious points of view. When ticking “false”, the respondents are
   confirming their rejection of a statement known to be accepted by a
   wide scientific community. A weak disagreement in a Likert scale should
   not be taken as equivalent as rejection, as one could say that there is
   some disagreement regarding the presented cipher, as a professional
   paleontologist probably would argue about the precise age of our
   planet. This disagreement cannot be taken as similar to the one from a
   Young Earth creationist, but in a Likert scale, both would have similar
   scores (1 and 2 out of 5 points in the Likert scale).

   Thus, in such cases, weak and strong disagreement may represent
   completely different attitudes, but with similar numerical values,
   undermining the measure’s precision. The option to change the
   instrument’s true/false options could enhance measurability, a critical
   aspect of survey sampling [58]. Thus, contrary to some of our previous
   pieces of research, we did not adopt Likert scale items in the
   questionnaire used in this study, which is presented below.

Materials and methods

Survey instrument

   We sought to measure evolution acceptance based on five clear
   statements related to the evolutionary theory: Earth age, the fossil
   record, common ancestry, and the origin of human beings. We included an
   item about understanding, related to deep time, as it has been
   considered a relevant barrier to evolution acceptance [59], while
   statements about human evolution are highly controversial even amongst
   biology teachers [60]. As mentioned before, the section of evolution
   provided scientific statements as a separated set of items as part of a
   longer questionnaire within the Relevance of Science Education (ROSE)
   project [see 56]. One seminar was held in Venice (Italy) and another in
   Brasília (Brazil) in the year 2012, bringing together researchers from
   both countries for the construction of the research instrument.
   Collaborative arrangements were defined for conducting joint data
   collection using the same instrument, whose final wording was defined
   after fieldwork and validation with students from two high schools in
   the following year and applied in early 2014 in both countries [54].

   Eight items related to evolution were offered to the students under a
   command line asking to simply tick each of the following statements as
   true or false, and a gentle refusal to answer the question (“I wouldn’t
   know how to put it”). The Italian expression (“non saprei dire”) was
   considered similar to the Portuguese translation adopted in Brazil
   (“não saberia dizer”). The statements are presented below, according to
   their identification in Section G of the questionnaire, which was then
   called the “SAPIENS Barometer” of the second round of the ROSE project
   in Italy and Brazil. The items read as follows:
     * G75—The formation of our planet occurred some 4.5 billion years
       ago;
     * G76—Fossils are evidence of living beings that lived in the past;
     * G77—Present-day species of animals and plants originated from other
       species of the past;
     * G78—Evolution occurs in both plants and animals;
     * G79—Humans are descended from other primate species;
     * G80—The human species has inhabited planet Earth in the last
       100,000 years;
     * G81—Different organisms may have a common ancestor;
     * G83—The first humans were prey to carnivorous dinosaurs.

   As item G82 was inadvertently absent in the Italian questionnaire, it
   was not considered here for comparisons between Brazilians and
   Italians.

Sample design and research ethics

   Sample design is basically composed of two aspects: a selection
   process, defining the rules and operations leading to the definition of
   clear targets in a wide population, and the estimation process, leading
   to sample estimates of population values [58]. These two aspects were
   standardized in both countries since the two research teams were taking
   part in the same international project above mentioned [56]. This
   international project targeted students who were beginning high school
   level for several reasons; one of them is related to the fact that at
   this age level, moral development is already completed in most
   cultures, predicting long-term behavior [61]. The study was conducted
   using stratified sampling both in Italy and Brazil.

   The Brazilian sample was designed as a sub-sample of the 2009 OECD-PISA
   sample and considered characteristics such as the offering of high
   school levels, the administrative organization of the school (public or
   private), the location (rural or urban, including all capitals and
   cities in the interior of each state), and the Human Development Index
   (HDI) of the state. There were three explicit stratification variables
   (state, grade status, and certainty), with a total of 82 explicit
   strata, and three implicit stratification variables (origin of funding,
   urban/rural, and HDI level) [62]. The PISA sample comprised 976 schools
   from the 27 units of the Brazilian Federation, from which 120 schools
   were randomly drawn, with implicit stratification to allow all
   federation units to be part of the subsample. This total included 20
   schools for replacement.

   Parcels with paper questionnaires and instructions were sent by
   ordinary mail to 100 schools located in 87 different municipalities all
   around the country after phone/email contact with the schools’
   principals [63]. Differences from the PISA procedures were explained.
   They were to select one classroom from the first year of high school
   (“primeiro ano do Ensino Médio”) by a random drawing. A reasonable
   number of schools (n = 78) returned the paper questionnaires after a
   few weeks, with short reports describing how the process was carried
   out and a signed letter (see below). After reading the report, the
   questionnaires were scanned for machine-reading, leading to a digital
   database with answers for 96 items and personal and family details,
   such as age, gender, religious membership, and socioeconomic
   indicators. The number of students reached 2,404 from 72 municipalities
   of 26 federative units of the country (see Appendix 1 in Oliveira [63,
   p. 288–9]).

   The sampling was carried out by the EDEVO-Darwin Research Nucleus in
   the first half of 2014, following all the applicable ethical
   procedures. The contact with school principals included an explanation
   of how the school was selected, differences from OECD/PISA technical
   procedures, the voluntary nature of participation, students’ right to
   withdraw at any time with no penalties, and the maintenance of the
   confidentiality of school participation and guarantee of student
   anonymity. School principals demonstrated their accordance with the
   ethical procedures, sending back the parcel with the questionnaires to
   the postal address of the research nucleus by ordinary mail, together
   with a signed letter of informed consent (see Appendix A in Pinafo [64,
   p. 437–442]). The expected risks and benefits were explained, and
   mutual advantages were effectively achieved [65]. The database built by
   the EDEVO-Darwin Research Nucleus was already anonymized, and, in
   addition, the schools were recoded to prevent identification. Very
   similar procedures were adopted by Observa, the institution that
   constructed the Italian database in the same time-frame (see below).

   The Italian sample was designed following the stratification model,
   with random drawings from the universe of secondary schools (n =
   2,862), with two explicit stratification variables (geographical area,
   Grade 2 middle school status), with a total of 18 explicit strata, and
   two implicit stratification variables (school type, town type). The
   official list included high schools and enrolled students in Grade 2 of
   middle school (“secondo anno della Scuola Media di Secondo Grado”), in
   the year 2013/2014 [66], which corresponds to the same age level of the
   Brazilian sample.

   The sampling in Italy was proportional to the number of students in the
   grade that year in each one of the geographical areas in which the
   country is divided, as follows: North-West (25%), North-East (18%),
   Center (18%), South (27%), and Islands (12%). A random selection of 100
   schools followed the above-mentioned proportions. Instead of having the
   urban/rural school-type stratification, standard sampling procedures
   adopted in similar surveys in Italy recommend dividing the sample into
   two parts, drawing half of the schools from the group of regional major
   towns (“comuni capoluogo”), and the other half from all other
   municipalities (“territorio provinciale”) [67]. The questionnaires were
   sent to 103 schools after 14 replacements were randomly selected,
   having received materials in return from 99 schools from 88
   municipalities from all geographical areas of the country, comprising
   3503 students. Differently from what happened in Brazil, the procedures
   for database entry from the paper questionnaires were done manually,
   with no machine-reading.

   In Italy, the questionnaires were delivered to two classrooms for each
   selected school. The teachers explained to the students the objectives
   of the ROSE survey in each classroom by specifying how to fill it out
   and ensuring that the questionnaire was completely anonymous, along
   with all the other conditions in compliance with Italian legislation at
   the time (2014) [68]. Subsequently, after a brief introduction to the
   questionnaire, the students filled it out in paper or in the school
   computer lab, under teacher supervision, assuring they were working
   individually. Regulations for research on education in Italy are
   similar to the Brazilian ones and were followed, with no identification
   of the students or schools in the public databank, which was merged
   with the Brazilian one.

   The aggregated databank has been used for independent analyses,
   generating doctoral theses at different institutions and in several
   publications [46,63,64,69]. Using an anonymous database with public
   access, the authors did not submit the statistical analysis protocol to
   an Institutional Research Review Board in advance.

Data collection

   The survey took place between March and May 2014 in both countries.
   Paper-and-pencil questionnaires were used in both countries, as well as
   electronic forms in some schools in Italy, all under absolute
   anonymity. The instrument consisted of a section regarding personal
   data (gender, age, living place), some socioeconomic questions, 73
   Likert scale items, and the true/false section on evolution (G
   Section), which is the focus of the present study (see Annex A in
   Oliveira [63]).

   The students had roughly the same age level in both countries, being
   around 15 years old. Valid cases comprised only students from 14 to 16
   years old. There was a slight difference in the gender proportion in
   the two countries, as girls slightly outnumbered boys in Brazil (55%)
   and Italy (52%). The declaration of religion is a sensitive issue, and
   each country had a different presentation of the question. In Brazil,
   there was a direct question about religious affiliation (yes/no) and 18
   options for answers (Catholic/Orthodox/Evangelical denominations (10
   options), Jewish/ Buddhist/African denominations (2 options),
   Kardecist, and an “other” option). Some 12% of Brazilian students
   declared not to follow any religion. A high proportion of Brazilian
   religious students declared to be Catholic (56%); the largest
   non-Catholic Christian group was the Pentecostal Christians (21%),
   followed by Mission Evangelicals (10%), which were composed mainly of
   Baptists (6%) and Seventh-Day Adventists (2%). The number of Orthodox,
   Lutheran, and Anglican Christians was low, less than 1%. Other
   religions amounted to some 13% [63].

   In the Italian context, this section asked a general question about
   religion or transcendent philosophy. Two-thirds of the students
   declared to follow the Catholic religion (67%), and 22% declared not to
   follow any religion or transcendent philosophy. Of the respondents, 3%
   were non-Catholic Christians, and roughly the same were “other
   religions” (3.5%) [48]. Therefore, the total number of Catholics in our
   sample from the two countries was very high, reaching over 3,000 valid
   cases. The number of Brazilian non-Catholic Christians was reasonable,
   reaching 549 valid cases. However, they composed a very conservative
   group compared to, for instance, the group in Britain who responded to
   a survey about evolution [24], where the proportion of Anglicans and
   Lutherans was far higher than Pentecostal Christians and Independent
   Evangelical Christians, the two main groups in Brazil.

Statistical and numerical analyses

   All analyses were performed using the statistical software IBM SPSS
   Statistics 26. We used Chi-square statistics to determine if there were
   statistically significant differences between the answers from the two
   countries, different religious affiliations in the same country, and
   between Catholics of the two countries. Column proportion tests were
   also performed, testing whether, for each row, the proportion of
   respondents in one column was significantly different from the
   proportion in the other column. For each item, a global significance
   level of 5% was adopted. As we were working with multiple comparisons,
   the significance level for each individual test was adjusted according
   to the Bonferroni correction method [70] to maintain a global
   significance of 5%. Additional tables with general results can be found
   in the Supporting Information (S1 and S2 Tables). As the results show
   very significant differences, we tackled the problem of association
   among a set of variables using a multivariate method, multiple
   correspondence analysis (MCA) [71]. Another set of tables was provided,
   excluding the neutral option, and allowing for an exploratory graph
   (biplot) to be drawn with the true/false answers from seven items with
   significant values (G75, G76, G77, G79, G80, G81, and G83) from the
   samples of the two countries. The reasons to exclude G78, taking its
   results as outliers, are presented in the Supporting Information (S1
   File). For this analysis, the normalization method followed the main
   variable, using default procedures of IBM SPSS Statistics v.26. Each
   item was recorded according to the individuals’ nationality, religion,
   and option (true/false), generating eight labels:
     * 1 = BC + (Brazilian Catholic who answered “True”);
     * 2 = BC—(Brazilian Catholic who answered “False”);
     * 3 = BNC + (Brazilian non-Catholic Christian who answered “True”);
     * 4 = BNC—(Brazilian Christian non-Catholic who answered “False”);
     * 5 = IC + (Italian Catholic who answered “True”);
     * 6 = IC- (Italian Catholic who answered “False”);
     * 7 = INC + (non-Catholic Christian Italian who answered “True”);
     * 8 = INC- (Italian Christian non-Catholic who answered “False”).

   This led to a generalization showing four clear groups of students
   separated by both religion and nationality. The total number of
   students in the two countries who declared their religion was 3,944,
   but 63 had missing values in all seven items and were not considered;
   therefore, a total of 3,881 cases were processed. S3 Table in the
   Supporting Information shows the case-processing summary, S4 Table
   presents the numbers of every religious group in the two countries, and
   S5 Table shows the degree of association of each item with the two
   dimensions of the analysis. Supporting Information (S2 File) brings a
   detailed study of the MCA analysis (S6.1 to S6.10 Table in S2 File),
   leading to the conclusion that there is no evidence that the MCA
   results have any significant bias when comparing the responses of valid
   active cases with those with missing values. In the same file, a link
   provides access to the databank and the SPSS syntaxes.

   We then estimated the differences between the Christian denominations
   (Catholics and non-Catholics) within the same country (Brazil), such
   that BCat—BNCat = ΔBChr. In addition, we estimated differences within
   the same religion (Catholics) between countries (Brazil and Italy),
   such that ICat—BCat = ΔCat. Thereupon, we created an intercultural
   index (IntcI) to compare these differences, such that
   [MATH: <mi mathvariant="normal">I</mi><mi
   mathvariant="normal">n</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi><mi
   mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mi
   mathvariant="normal">I</mi><mo>=</mo><mo>|</mo><mi

   mathvariant="normal">h</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">r</mi><mo>|</mo>
   :MATH]
   (1)

   If the intercultural index was higher than 1 (IntcI>1), this meant that
   the Brazilian and Italian Catholics had more differences amongst
   themselves than among Brazilian Catholics and Brazilian non-Catholics
   Christians. This indicated that sociocultural factors played a more
   important role in the acceptance of evolution than religion itself. If
   the index was lower than 1 (IntcI<1) this indicated the opposite, that
   religion played a major role.

Results

   Previous analyses of this sample already showed significant differences
   between Brazilian and Italian students [54,63]. It was clear that when
   human evolution was specifically the focus, the level of acceptance of
   evolution was lower in both countries. The same broad results were
   found in places where the context is particularly important for the
   historical development of the theory of evolution, such as the
   Galapagos Islands [72,73]. These analyses suggest that religion plays a
   considerable role in the level of support for evolution. S1 and S2
   Tables in the Supporting Information provide a wider view, showing that
   the Brazilian and Italian students have very significant differences
   (p< 0.0005) regarding their answers to all items.

   Our main objective was to verify whether the answers in the same
   religious group (Catholics) were more similar in the two countries than
   among different denominations (Catholic and non-Catholic Christians)
   within the same country (Brazil). Thus, we compared students from the
   two countries who share the same religion. Table 1 presents the results
   for each item comparing Brazilian and Italian Catholics.

   In the first analysis of the Brazilian sample (Table 3), we found four
   items (G78, G80, G81, and G83) with no significant differences between
   Brazilian Catholics and Brazilian non-Catholic Christians. Two of them,
   G80 (“Human species has inhabited planet Earth in the last 100,000
   years”), and G81 (“Different organisms may have a common ancestor”) had
   roughly the same answers in the two groups, with a high proportion of
   the “I would not know how to put it”. Answers to the last item, G83
   (“The first humans were prey to carnivorous dinosaurs”) are evidence of
   a considerable lack of understanding about geological time in both
   groups in Brazil.

   The only truly unexpected result with Intercultural Index (IntcI)
   values was found with item G80, which states "Human species has
   inhabited planet Earth in the last 100,000 years", as the level of
   agreement was lower among Italian Catholics than Brazilian ones (Tables
   ​(Tables11 and ​and2).2). The level of disagreement (around 30%) to
   this statement was higher than agreement (around 20%), and around 50%
   of Catholic Italians preferred not to answer it. In Brazil, the
   situation was also unexpected, as there were no statistically
   significant differences between different religious denominations. The
   abstention of Brazilian religious students was also high (around 56%)
   and the level of disagreement in both groups was low (15%) compared to
   the level of agreement (almost 30%). Therefore, there were significant
   differences between Brazilian and Italian Catholics, but opposite to
   what was expected.

   In this case, Italian youngsters could have taken the statement as an
   exact cipher to be confirmed or not, due to a refined lexicon
   interpretation derived from literal translation. Well-informed students
   about human paleontological details may know that the human species
   appeared longer than 100,000 years before present, and may have decided
   to take the statement as false, or rather to refrain from giving a
   clear opinion. On the Brazilian side, the level of understanding about
   paleontology was lower, as shown by the answers of item G83, leading to
   a decreased level of criticism upon the statement, but with higher
   abstention. The anomalous behavior of the item can also be noticed in
   the two dimensions of the biplot graph, as the degree of association of
   the item with the dimensions of the analysis had the lowest value (see
   S5 Table in the Supporting Information).

   Brazilian Catholics showed a significantly lower level of knowledge
   about geological time than the Italians (Tables ​(Tables11 and
   ​and2).2). However, there were no significant differences between the
   two Christian denominations in Brazil (Tables ​(Tables33 and ​and4).4).
   Thus, the reason for Italians to disagree with the statement of G80
   could be different from that of the Brazilians, showing a polarized
   pattern due to differences in understanding that are related to
   education. Therefore, the answers could have resulted from their
   different level of information, following the general pattern of the
   two samples, and the item was not discarded.

   The results tend to show that those who follow the very same religion,
   listening to the teaching of the very same Catholic religious
   authorities in different countries, had bigger differences regarding
   evolution acceptance from people who were brought up in the same
   socio-cultural environment but followed different religious teachings.
   In addition, differences in understanding tended to follow the same
   pattern. This hypothesis found additional support with the multiple
   correspondence analysis (MCA), analyzing the "true" and "false" options
   in the two religious denominations in the two countries in all items.
   The overall picture can be seen in Fig 1.

   The graph of joint categories (biplot) displays the average scores of
   the two dimensions for individuals belonging to the four categories.
   The origin of the graph represents an individual who belongs to the
   most frequent category of each variable; therefore, profiles that are
   far from the origin indicate groups that are outside of the general
   pattern of the data. There are four clear groups of respondents,
   showing that Catholics do not form a homogenous group. On the contrary,
   Brazilian and Italian Catholics are far from being in the same general
   pattern of answers, confirming what is seen in Tables ​Tables11 and
   ​and22.

   The relative numbers of “true” answers were then compared and the
   module of the differences between Catholics in the two countries
   originated the delta Catholics (ΔCat), as well as the differences
   between Christian denominations in the same country (ΔBChr) used in Eq
   1. The results can be seen in Table 5.

   These results were plotted as shown in Fig 2, which gives a better idea
   of the general results in terms of the relative importance of religion
   (orange polygon) and wider socio-cultural factors within each country
   (blue polygon). The religion borderline assumes that there should be
   small differences between the same Christian denomination (Christian
   Catholic) in the two countries, and higher differences between the two
   different Christian denominations. Therefore, the results appear
   plotted inside the orange polygon. Differences in the understanding of
   geological time followed the same pattern, with a very high score (G83
   IntcI = 7.41), but they were not included in the same figure as they
   are not related to acceptance (see text).

   The area of the small polygon corresponds to the expected result in the
   case that all Christians had similar answers in both countries. The
   blue polygon indicates greater differences between Catholics in both
   countries than differences between the two groups of Christians in the
   same country (Brazil).

Discussion

   Research on evolution education faced a big challenge after the
   surprising findings showing that different instruments lead to
   different rates of agreement/rejection of evolution in the same student
   population [6]. We tried to show that some instruments could have had
   problems in terms of their methodology, implying distortions for the
   numerical analysis, as measurements could result in some bias. These
   distortions can explain, at least in part, the mentioned puzzle. In
   addition, there is not consensus in the educational community about how
   important religion is for the acceptance of evolution.

   We presented a new instrument, stating some principles on how to
   evaluate students’ opinions concerning evolution, asking clear
   positions about well-known statements on the subject and using
   nationwide samples of students of the same age (around 15 years old)
   and absolute anonymity.

   The results show a clear picture of the two countries, which is in line
   with recent data [45], but with a specific focus on two groups of
   Christians, with significant differences between Catholics in Italy and
   Brazil. Moreover, the differences were larger between students from the
   same Christian denomination (Roman Catholic) but different countries
   than from different Christian denominations in the same country
   (Brazil). The MCA found clear distinct groups of respondents. However,
   this is simply an exploratory data technique, and the final picture
   should be seen in a purely descriptive way, without the power of
   indicating a precise output of a statistical test. As the number of
   valid cases involved was not very high (n = 3,881), relative distances
   that can be inferred should be viewed with caution (see S5 Table in
   Supporting Information).

   Item G79 ("Humans are descended from other primate species") was based
   on the well-known instrument “MATE”, keeping the same wording in the
   revised version [8] for the statement about humans, revealing
   difficulties of evolution in 34 countries [2]. Many studies have shown
   that when the human species is concerned, opinions about evolution tend
   to be extreme, with some people considering evolution for all organisms
   except our species [60]. This is perhaps the best item to test the
   hypothesis we have been examining, as the number of respondents of both
   countries was not low (n = 3,117). There was a clear shift between the
   Roman Catholics, with a high acceptance (84.7%) and low rejection
   (5.9%) among Italians, whereas in Brazil, the situation was very
   different, with a significantly lower acceptance (48.5%) and higher
   rejection (21.5%) (Table 1). Within Brazil, differences between
   Christian denominations were lower (Table 3).

   Tables ​Tables33 and ​and44 show that G81 (“Different organisms may
   have a common ancestor”) had no significant statistical differences
   between religious denominations in the same country, and Tables
   ​Tables11 and ​and22 show very significant differences between Roman
   Catholics in the two different countries. As these differences refer to
   the very same religious denomination, which has very similar values and
   beliefs in the two countries, it would be reasonable to expect the
   opposite situation, with no significant differences among people who
   follow the same religious teachings from an early age.

   The level of understanding about geological time was very different
   between Italian and Brazilian Catholics, but a similar level of low
   knowledge was found in both Christian denominations in Brazil. This not
   only adds evidence to the importance of understanding this important
   concept for evolution acceptance, but also shows that education and
   religion have a strong link with nationality, adding evidence to
   previously published studies [6,24]. In our case, Italian Catholics had
   a higher acceptance as well as a higher level of understanding of
   evolution than Brazilian ones. Independent recent research obtained
   similar results, showing that Catholic and Evangelical Brazilian
   university students had low levels of knowledge about evolution [74].

   Notwithstanding this general picture found after the MCA, additional
   evidence in numerical terms supports the idea that religion alone does
   not play a major role in the acceptance of evolution, with the relative
   size of differences obtained by the Intercultural Index (IntcI). It
   tended to show small numbers (IntcI<1) in cases where religion played a
   major role, but the results point in the exact opposite direction, as
   acceptance was far more similar between different religions in the same
   country than between Catholics in the two different countries.

   All IntcI values were higher than 1, reaching values as high as 9, as
   in the case of item G81, which states that different organisms may have
   a common ancestor. This can be regarded as a clear-cut, widely known,
   scientific principle of common ancestry, and a basic principle for
   biological evolution. The calculated Intercultural Index for item G79
   (“Humans are descended from other primate species”) was high (IntcI =
   1.889), showing that differences within Catholics were almost twice as
   high as those between them and non-Catholic Christians in the same
   country (Brazil).

   The general picture shows that religion plays a less important role in
   the acceptance of evolution than nationality, which should be regarded
   as the wide socio-cultural environment, including religion and
   education. Children develop a range of different worldviews, which can
   affect their position towards science and scientific statements [75].
   However, the acceptance of evolution cannot be seen as a simple output
   of a given worldview but as a complex result of several influences.

   No one doubts that literalist interpretations of sacred texts can
   influence the learning processes of young students since early
   childhood. The development of understanding of central concepts can be
   seriously hampered by the influence of fundamentalist religious faith.
   The conceptual discussion about belief, faith, and acceptance
   [49,50,76] may be more worthwhile than creating more research
   instruments.

   The instrument presented here could be applied in different settings,
   and research could be carried out with samples easier to obtain, not
   necessarily nationwide ones. Databanks already providing items with
   clear-cut scientific statements could be recoded, transforming Likert
   scale numbers into true/false answers. Then, the Intercultural Index
   presented here could objectively show the relative importance of
   religion for evolution acceptance. If our results are to be confirmed
   in the future, this could provide considerable consequences for making
   concrete recommendations for evolution education to religious students
   in conservative and anti-science environments.

   It is important to keep in mind that the picture presented here is only
   one frame of a long film, as values are changing very rapidly, even in
   religious settings. For instance, the level of acceptance of evolution
   has improved considerably within members of some conservative Christian
   denominations whose teachings are informed by cultural barriers to
   evolution [35]. Unfortunately, change can also be noticed in the
   opposite direction, with conservative anti-evolution groups and
   religious denominations showing a growing influence around the world,
   Brazil included [39–41,74].

Acknowledgments

   Data collection was possible due to the collaboration between the
   Italian researchers of OBSERVA, Science in Society, and the Brazilian
   researchers and staff at the School of Education (FEUSP), and
   EDEVO-Darwin Research Nucleus (Pró-Reitoria de Pesquisa/USP). IBM SPSS
   v.26 statistical analyses were performed by Estéfano A. de Souza. Many
   people contributed in different regards to this research, especially P.
   Abrantes, R. Alitto, E. Almeida, L. Bizzo, D. Borges, V. Barzotto, C.
   Boto, T. Forato, F. Franzolin, P. Garcia, A. Gouw, S. Martorano, P.
   Monteiro, M. Neira, I. Nogueira, M. Prestes, P. Prado, P. Sano, and H.
   Viana. We also have to thank a number of teachers, principals,
   students, and their families from high schools throughout Italy and
   Brazil for their help with data collection. Access to the PISA/Brazil
   school database was provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Education,
   INEP/DACC.

   Additional Editor Comments (if provided):

   This ms addresses an important topic - why does evolution acceptance
   differ? - and takes new approaches to address it.

   I found the results intriguing.

   Still, the reviewers noted several concerns about both the methodology
   of the study and the presentation in the ms. I would like to see the
   authors’ responses to these. think the Introduction can be compressed
   somewhat without loss of information. There are sections - as noted by
   the reviewers - that can be clarified.

   In addition to the comments made by the reviewers, I think the
   presentation of the tables can be improved. Notably, I suggest adding a
   brief descriptor in addition to the G number in each table. So, G75
   could be “planet age”, G76 could be “fossils”, and so on.

   5. Review Comments to the Author

   Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions
   above. You may also include additional comments for the author,
   including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or
   publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it
   exceeds 20,000 characters)

   Reviewer #1: This article examines compare acceptance of evolution in
   high school students in Italy and Brazil, specifically looking at 1)
   the overall differences in acceptance between countries 2) whether
   level of acceptance is associated more strongly with a specific
   Christian denomination (Roman Catholic) in both countries, and 3)
   whether acceptance of evolution by both Catholic and non-Catholic
   Christian students within each country are more similar to each other.
   The authors found that the level of evolution acceptance is more
   similar among students within each country than among Roman Catholics
   in both countries. They conclude that "the sociocultural environment
   and level of evolutionary knowledge" is more important than the
   specific religious affiliation they studied (from the abstract), and
   that "religion playing a less important role for the acceptance of
   evolution that nationality" (from lines 648-649). It is an elegant
   study and should be published.

   However, I have some suggestions that I think will strengthen the
   manuscript, listed below. Some are broader and more important, and some
   are more minor.

   1. There are many areas where the article is not clearly written, and
   includes awkward phrasing that I am interpreting as the result of
   English not being the authors' first language. At times this impeded my
   ability to read and understand the article. As PLOS ONE does not
   copyedit accepted manuscripts, I would strongly recommend that the
   authors have a proofreader assist with this issue.

   2. Throughout the paper the authors refer to "different Christian
   religions". I have more often heard this referred to as different
   Christian religious denominations, all falling under the single
   religion of Christianity. The authors should consider changing this
   accordingly.

   3. There are some areas of the introduction which are repetitive (e.g.,
   lines 98-101). I recommend that this section be condensed, and that
   less details of previous studies be provided (e.g., lines 112-125; the
   reader does not need to know the details of how the analysis was done -
   the shorter description of another study in lines 126-131 is a better
   approach).

   4. Since this study focuses on acceptance of evolution among Roman
   Catholic students, the "explicit views on biological evolution"
   referenced in 146 should be described in more detail.

   5. I am not sure that reference 35 in line 167 is the appropriate
   reference for that information.

   6. The explanation of why they had the students answer their survey
   anonymously (lines 213-226) was interesting, but there are no citations
   provided for their reasoning. The addition of citations would be
   helpful, or being clear that this is opinion/conjecture. The same for
   their reasoning about why a Likert scale is not appropriate for
   statements expressing scientific facts, as they should not be "graded
   as weak or strong" (lines 243-286). Basically, I would like to see some
   references to survey design to help the reader have confidence that
   their decisions were based on best practices or previous research. I do
   appreciate the nuance that a Likert scale could score different
   approaches to an answer about the age of the planet similarly thought
   they might come from different places of disagreement - precision of
   scientific evidence vs. a non-scientific view (lines 275-280).

   7. Line 358 mentions "personal and family details" - what are these?
   Either explain or omit this.

   8. Line 610 mentions a "well-known instrument" - please include the
   name of this instrument.

   9. Mention the question number of the survey that the results described
   beginning with line 626 come from.

   10. I am concerned about the somewhat strident tone in lines 655-658
   regarding fundamentalist religious faith - not all fundamentalist
   religious people deny "the objective existence of well-founded
   scientific facts". I also recommend removing the word "notorious" in
   line 672 for the same reason.

   11. Which "certain conservative religions" are being referred to in
   lines 671-672? Be explicit.

   Reviewer #2: Thank you for the opportunity to read this manuscript.
   This study follows up on prior work on evolution acceptance in Brazil
   and Italy (“Previous analysis of this sample had already shown
   significant differences between Brazilian and Italian students…”). The
   manuscript makes the claim that culture is more important than religion
   using Catholics in Brazil and Italy. Few would doubt that culture
   matters (or that religion matters) but the question is by how much and
   why does this matter? The study has a very large number of
   methodological weaknesses that need to be addressed.

   Introduction

   The introduction discusses how knowledge and the nature of science
   relate to acceptance, and yet the manuscript did not seem to measure
   these core variables. Differences in these variables between countries
   could explain the acceptance patterns discussed. This was a confusing
   aspect of the introduction and the study.

   The introduction emphasizes “inconsistencies” and “differences” in
   prior research findings relating to acceptance and knowledge. However,
   the contexts of comparison (e.g., ages, countries), magnitudes of
   differences (e.g., effect sizes), meaning of the differences in light
   of the intended measures (e.g., instrument construct definitions), and
   quality of the studies (e.g., sampling, measurement statistics) being
   discussed were not carefully considered. A much more careful and
   rigorous review of the literature is needed. The current introduction
   does not carefully review studies with direct relevance to the
   populations of interest.

   Line 59. The claim regarding “inconsistencies” is not supported by the
   literature. Studies examining different populations with different
   instruments and different levels of education cannot be meaningfully
   compared. Moreover, studies vary greatly in the quality of the measures
   and the rigor of the analyses. Studies of the same populations using
   the same or similar instruments demonstrate few if any differences, and
   those that were found tend to be small effect sizes (many significant
   differences are not meaningful, particularly when using large samples).
   Knowledge and acceptance have a positive association and this is widely
   supported. Claims of contradiction and inconsistency do not align with
   the preponderance of evidence in high quality studies. We can find
   published studies that contradict almost anything, but they tend to
   have significant flaws. Not all studies are equal. A RCT and a static
   descriptive finding are not of the same quality.

   Line 66. The effect sizes for Barnes were not large, and the
   instruments utilized were intentionally designed to measure different
   aspects of evolution acceptance. It is NOT a flaw to intentionally
   conceptualize (and operationalize) a theoretical construct in different
   ways. Why would small differences using instruments that measure a
   construct in slightly different ways be “surprising”? Fahrenheit and
   Celcius are different scales of temperature–is one flawed because it
   produces a different measure? They are based on different
   operationalizations of theory.

   This introduction could be fixed by reviewing findings from
   high-quality studies most similar in terms of religion, age, education,
   etc. to the new research that will be reported.

   Sample

   It is not clear why the two countries are being compared if the Pew
   studies have shown significant differences in evolution acceptance (and
   prior work). A stronger and clearer rationale for the comparisons (in
   light of the methodological issues noted above) needs to be made so
   that readers can see what the authors are trying to do (which is
   interesting).

   Methods

   It was not clear how religious affiliation and religiosity were
   measured–were they separate? These are two well-defined constructs that
   are different.

   The methods discuss measuring evolution acceptance, but later on the
   discussion mentions “understanding” in several places. It was not clear
   if there is a knowledge measure and an acceptance measure. Or are the
   authors conflating acceptance and understanding? This was confusing.
   (e.g., “Difference of geological time understanding followed the same
   pattern, with a very high score”).

   Line 250. It is important to consider that Likert scales by themselves
   are not instruments or measures. Measures are derived from the scale,
   and such scales pose many problems (e.g., non-ratio scaling) that can
   distort inferences. The way that these issues are discussed is
   problematic and should be revised.

   Line 288. The introduction emphasizes that different instruments that
   measure constructs in different ways produce different results, and so
   it was surprising to read that a new instrument that has not been
   widely used was employed in this study. How, then, can the results be
   compared to prior work? It seems that the problems emphasized in the
   introduction are ignored and the authors continue the tradition of
   comparing patterns using different tools. How will this move research
   forward? The methodological approach was puzzling. Regardless, evidence
   in support of instrument quality needs to be expanded as it is
   inappropriate to interpret measures unless there is a robust body of
   evidence supporting them (see Mead et al. Evolution Education Outreach
   on instrument quality in evolution education). Please report comparable
   evidence types for the instrument.

   The sampling methods should include information on missing data and
   whether it was missing at random (e.g., did students of particular
   groups have disproportionate missing data?). The participation rate
   should be mentioned in the main text.

   The data have clear nesting and HLM (hierarchical linear models) would
   allow for the analyses of patterns within schools, regions, and
   countries. The current methodological approach is very unusual and so a
   rationale is needed for why MCA was used.

   Why were the data on nationality and religion used to code responses
   when it would be possible to use predictor variables contained within
   the dataset? In other words, the analyses ignore the richness of the
   dataset and predispose the results to the coding scheme. This is
   problematic and poorly justified. Within- and between- group variation
   can be modeled along with interactions.

   The discussion section should emphasize why these results matter. Let’s
   say that the results are well supported by evidence (which is by no
   means clear). How does this change how biologists should approach the
   challenge of evolution education? What are the implications for other
   countries? How should sociocultural factors be measured and included in
   models of acceptance?The discussion section should also include prior
   evolution education research in nonreligious contexts such as China and
   other international studies (please review Donnelly and Deniz Springer
   and other studies).

   Additional Editor Comments

   “Introduction can be compressed somewhat without loss of information”.

   Answer: The introduction has been shortened based on reviewers'
   comments. Changes are specified in the comments for reviewers.

   "I think the presentation of the tables can be improved. Notably, I
   suggest adding a brief descriptor in addition to the G number in each
   table. So, G75 could be “planet age”, G76 could be “fossils”, and so
   on”

   Answer: As suggested, brief descriptors were added to the G number in
   each table.

   Reviewer #1

   “1. There are many areas where the article is not clearly written, (…)
   I would strongly recommend that the authors have a proofreader assist
   with this issue”.

   Answer: The article has undergone English language editing by a
   professional reviewer (MDPI). The text has been checked for correct use
   of grammar and common technical terms, and edited to a level suitable
   for reporting research in a scholarly journal.

   “2. Throughout the paper the authors refer to "different Christian
   religions". I have more often heard this referred to as different
   Christian religious denominations, all falling under the single
   religion of Christianity”.

   Answer: In fact, this is a longstanding problematic issue. Some authors
   criticize the term “denomination”, for instance: “When we use the
   analytical term ‘religion,’ we must not think that it refers to some
   specific, ‘least common denominator’ super- religion or trans-
   religious entity, which can be partitioned into ‘denominations’. No
   such thing exists. All that exists in actuality are particular
   religions.” (Smith, 2017, p.46). However, soon after the same author
   recognizes that this ideal conceptual approach cannot be found in US
   publications, which prefer to call all Christian branches “Christian
   denominations”, as he himself used to call them (Smith, 2000). Roman
   Catholic theologians, such as John Haught, avoid the term; in his
   famous book “Science and Religion: From conflict to conversation”
   (1995), he does not use the expression “Christian denominations”. Thus,
   this way of referring to Christianity as a “trans-religious entity” is
   widely used, as by Thomas Dixon, in his book “Science and Religion: A
   very short introduction” (2008, Oxford University Press). Therefore, we
   decided to modify the expression to the most used/understandable way of
   defining religions in the US and changed all references of “Christian
   religions” into “Christian denominations”.

   “3. There are some areas of the introduction which are repetitive
   (e.g., lines 98-101). I recommend that this section be condensed, and
   that less details of previous studies be provided”.

   Answer: We condensed the discussion in the lines indicated above (lines
   169-170) and elsewhere.

   “4. Since this study focuses on acceptance of evolution among Roman
   Catholic students, the "explicit views on biological evolution"
   referenced in L.146 should be described in more detail”

   Answer: We included a brief description of previous studies in Brazil
   carried out in the early 1990s, but consider that the reference that
   was already in the text (Oliveira & Cook, 2019) addresses appropriately
   the issue, which should be seen in a dynamic perspective.

   “5. I am not sure that reference 35 in line 167 is the appropriate
   reference for that information.”

   Answer: This reference is the Pew Research Center report, which
   “examines public perceptions of biotechnology, evolution and the
   relationship between science and religion. Data in this report come
   from a survey conducted across Europe, Russia, the Americas and the
   Asia-Pacific region from October 2019 to March 2020. Surveys were
   through face-to-face interviews in Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic,
   India and Brazil”. The title adopted as bibliographical reference is
   the one recommended by the report.

   “6. The explanation of why they had the students answer their survey
   anonymously (lines 213-226) was interesting, but there are no citations
   provided for their reasoning (…) Basically, I would like to see some
   references to survey design to help the reader have confidence that
   their decisions were based on best practices or previous research.”

   Answer: Strong pieces of evidence published in the literature shows
   that anonymity reduces social desirability distortion and increases
   self-disclosure. This research was part of an international project
   originally designed back to 2004-6 relying on basic literature. Many
   references are available in the literature and we understand that this
   is a well established concept when sensitive issues are involved.
   However, we included two basic references regarding more recent
   research, addressing social desirability, including a meta-analysis
   comprising 51 studies that included 62 independent samples and 16,700
   unique participants.

   “7. Line 358 mentions ‘personal and family details’ - what are these?
   Either explain or omit this”.

   Answer: We introduced one line explaining that the databank includes
   students’ age, gender, religious membership, and socioeconomic
   indicators.

   “8. Line 610 mentions a "well-known instrument" - please include the
   name of this instrument.”

   Answer: We included the name of the “well known instrument” mentioned
   in the article soon after, and a recent reference, but also rephrased
   the first mention of it, in the introduction.

   “9. Mention the question number of the survey that the results
   described beginning with line 626 come from.”

   Answer: The cited number (n=3,117) refers to G79 (“Human origins”), and
   comprises the total number students who answered “true” or “false”
   (“active cases”), in the group of Roman Catholics in Italy and Brazil
   (n=2,731) (Table 1), and Non-Catholic Christians in Brazil (n=386)
   (Table 3), so that 2,731+386=3,117. We added more details in that
   paragraph to make it easier to trace back the numbers.

   10. I am concerned about the somewhat strident tone in lines 655-658
   regarding fundamentalist religious faith - not all fundamentalist
   religious people deny "the objective existence of well-founded
   scientific facts". I also recommend removing the word "notorious" in
   line 672 for the same reason.

   Answer: Both suggestions were accepted and the text was rephrased.

   “11. Which "certain conservative religions" are being referred to in
   lines 671-672? Be explicit.”

   Answer: We introduced some changes in that paragraph, and kept the
   reference, which indicates a concrete example in a given sociocultural
   context.

   Reviewer #2

   A-“The introduction discusses how knowledge and the nature of science
   relate to acceptance, and yet the manuscript did not seem to measure
   these core variables. Differences in these variables between countries
   could explain the acceptance patterns discussed. This was a confusing
   aspect of the introduction and the study”.

   Answer: Our study did not aim at studying deeply the variable we were
   interested for: religion. We tried to throw light on the influence of
   religion in evolution acceptance at a certain age level, with
   probabilistic nationwide samples of two countries with large numbers of
   students who declare themselves as Roman Catholic. It is a far more
   modest objective that examining “how knowledge and the nature of
   science relate to acceptance”. However, the introduction was
   reformulated, trying to let our objectives clearer.

   B-“The introduction emphasizes “inconsistencies” and “differences” in
   prior research findings relating to acceptance and knowledge. However,
   the contexts of comparison (e.g., ages, countries), magnitudes of
   differences (e.g., effect sizes), meaning of the differences in light
   of the intended measures (e.g., instrument construct definitions), and
   quality of the studies (e.g., sampling, measurement statistics) being
   discussed were not carefully considered. A much more careful and
   rigorous review of the literature is needed. The current introduction
   does not carefully review studies with direct relevance to the
   populations of interest.”

   Answer: There are several recent studies on the subject, with different
   methodologies and sampling methods and we were asked to present a more
   concise revision of previous research. As the article is not a
   revision, we tried to meet such a query. Thus, we introduced a
   consideration for the reader to consider the comparison contexts of the
   previously cited studies.

   C-“Line 59. The claim regarding “inconsistencies” is not supported by
   the literature. Studies examining different populations with different
   instruments and different levels of education cannot be meaningfully
   compared. Moreover, studies vary greatly in the quality of the measures
   and the rigor of the analyses.

   Answer: We removed the paragraph that compares studies with different
   populations, leaving the discussion on inconsistencies restricted to
   the study by Barnes et al. (2019) that analyzed the same group with
   different analysis instruments. Deleted paragraph: “"However, data are
   still contradictory and require further investigation. An example of
   inconsistencies found so far is that some studies report a strong
   relationship between evolution acceptance and religious beliefs, while
   other studies report a weak relationship between them [6]. The use of
   different instruments to measure evolution acceptance could be a cause
   of such inconsistent research results."

   D-“Line 66. The effect sizes for Barnes were not large, and the
   instruments utilized were intentionally designed to measure different
   aspects of evolution acceptance. It is NOT a flaw to intentionally
   conceptualize (and operationalize) a theoretical construct in different
   ways. Why would small differences using instruments that measure a
   construct in slightly different ways be “surprising”? Fahrenheit and
   Celcius are different scales of temperature–is one flawed because it
   produces a different measure? They are based on different
   operationalizations of theory.

   Answer: Data venia, apparently the analogy does not seem to be
   appropriate. The mentioned piece of research found differences in the
   very same population using elegant random methods. If one child has two
   thermometers, one reads 35C and the other 101F, it is clear that the
   difference is small, but it does mean something important, as they
   point to two different realities, demanding completely different
   procedures. It makes no sense to choose between Fahrenheit x Celsius
   Scale thermometers in this case. There is no doubt that at least one
   instrument is not working well (if not both!). Small differences can
   indicate completely different realities. Our discussion focuses
   precisely on this point, concerning the construction of instruments. We
   argued that Likert scaling (see below) should not be used with factual
   statements, as this brings imprecise numeric measures. “I like
   strawberry juice” will have a far more precise measure than “strawberry
   is a fruit” in a Likert scale item. Biologists will not fully agree,
   but will not fully disagree either, with the second statement. The same
   would occur with pineapples, apples and pears. However, with tomato
   juice one could expect the opposite situation, as biologists would
   promptly recognize it as a fruit, but as lay costumers use to find
   tomatoes near potatoes in supermarkets, they may disagree with the
   statement, not to mention the sonority of the two words (which is not
   the case with Romance languages). It is not difficult to see that an
   instrument with several such items answered by a large and diverse
   population, in different countries, will bring a cloudy picture due to
   imprecise numeric measures. Our conclusion indicates not only that
   future research should not use Likert scaling with factual statements
   about biological evolution, but also invites reanalysis of data banks.
   This is precisely what we did with our own database, finding surprising
   results.

   E-“This introduction could be fixed by reviewing findings from
   high-quality studies most similar in terms of religion, age, education,
   etc. to the new research that will be reported.”

   Answer: We have included five paragraphs and seven references, with
   studies on acceptance of evolution and Christian denominations of
   similar age level as ours in countries such as India and Chile. The
   paragraphs and references are:

   “A systematic literature review of the current state of research
   regarding students’ and teachers’ acceptance of evolution across Europe
   found that the level of acceptance of evolution in different
   educational settings is ambiguous. The authors argue that similar
   samples and a standardized assessment of the acceptance of evolution
   are necessary for cross-country comparisons [7].

   (…)

   A study with secondary school students (aged 14–16) in the United
   Kingdom found that teaching genetics before teaching evolution had a
   significant impact on improving evolution understanding but did not
   result in a significantly increased acceptance of evolution [16]. This
   reflects a weak correlation between the knowledge and acceptance of
   evolution, which also appears to be present in undergraduate students.
   In Chilean students of 15–16 years old, it was found that including
   instruction on the nature of science in the class on evolution improved
   their acceptance significantly [17].

   Kuschmierz et al. (2020) [7] identified 56 papers from the period of
   2010–2020 regarding students’ and teachers’ knowledge and acceptance of
   evolution across 29 European countries. However, according to the
   authors, the research findings were hard to compare due to the
   application of different instruments and the assessment of different
   key concepts. The available database was not sufficient to obtain
   reasonably comparable data from European countries. In addition, the
   ambiguous results of the research demonstrate multiple challenges
   regarding measurement of evolution education, such as (a) inadequate
   definitions of key constructs (attitudes, acceptance, knowledge, and
   understanding are often not defined or inconsistently used in
   publications); (b) the application of diverse measurement instruments
   (different evolution acceptance instruments may produce different
   results, even when applied to the same population); (c) the
   multidimensionality of knowledge about evolution (most instruments
   focus on single evolutionary constructs, such as natural selection and
   related concepts).

   The authors [18] then developed an instrument to measure attitudes and
   understanding across Europe and beyond, called the “Evolution Education
   Questionnaire on Acceptance and Knowledge” (EEQ). The measurement
   instrument was translated into several European languages, in the
   various Romance, Germanic, and Slavic branches, and was recently
   applied to 9200 first-year university students in 26 European countries
   [19].

   This is a recent initiative, and thus, due to a lack of standardized
   assessment procedures in the existing literature, previous results
   should be used with caution when trying to compare countries, as there
   are several limitations, such as different age levels, and sampling
   procedures, etc. [18].

   F-“It is not clear why the two countries are being compared if the Pew
   studies have shown significant differences in evolution acceptance (and
   prior work). A stronger and clearer rationale for the comparisons (in
   light of the methodological issues noted above) needs to be made so
   that readers can see what the authors are trying to do (which is
   interesting).”

   Answer: There is divergence between the two reviewers. The Pew studies
   were carried out with a different age level (18 years old and older),
   with a completely different methodology. We are emphasizing the broad
   sociocultural picture and the need of standardized methodological
   procedures, including careful item translation, aiming at producing
   meaningful comparisons among countries.

   G-“It was not clear how religious affiliation and religiosity were
   measured–were they separate? These are two well-defined constructs that
   are different.”

   Answer: We tried to state clearly that we compared students who
   declared their religion, with no measure of religiosity. Possibly
   language editing has solved this problem.

   H-“The methods discuss measuring evolution acceptance, but later on the
   discussion mentions ‘understanding’ in several places. It was not clear
   if there is a knowledge measure and an acceptance measure. Or are the
   authors conflating acceptance and understanding? This was confusing.
   (e.g., “Difference of geological time understanding followed the same
   pattern, with a very high score”)”.

   Answer: We rephrased the parts where we present the only item that
   relates to geological time. It is not included in the final figure,
   which tried to show the influence of religion on evolution acceptance.

   I-“Line 250. It is important to consider that Likert scales by
   themselves are not instruments or measures. Measures are derived from
   the scale, and such scales pose many problems (e.g., non-ratio scaling)
   that can distort inferences. The way that these issues are discussed is
   problematic and should be revised.”

   Answer: We deleted the phrase “The Likert scale is considered a good
   instrument to estimate the degree of agreement (or disagreement) about
   statements expressing opinions.”, and inserted a more precise
   description of our main criticism of previous instruments:

   “Likert scaling is used in instruments measuring attitudes, beliefs,
   and opinions about statements, allowing expression of moderation of
   opinion from agreement to disagreement. The key point is finding ways
   of calibrating how strongly or mildly a statement should be worded.
   These scales are therefore suitable for issues related to open
   constructs and less for scientific claims based on presumed factuality.
   An item likely to produce extreme responses, either full agreement or
   strong disagreement, would do a poor job of discriminating across the
   full spectrum of respondents [57]. Therefore, Likert scales may not be
   a good choice with statements expressing well-known scientific facts.
   In addition, in the case of theories of evolution, factuality is
   supported by the school context in which the questionnaires were filled
   out. The battery of items on evolution was proposed with dichotomous
   questions given that each of them can have minimal variability”.

   A previous answer (#D) brought additional elements for this discussion,
   but may not be relevant in the context of the manuscript, considering
   writing style and content.

   K-“ Line 288. The introduction emphasizes that different instruments
   that measure constructs in different ways produce different results,
   and so it was surprising to read that a new instrument that has not
   been widely used was employed in this study. How, then, can the results
   be compared to prior work? It seems that the problems emphasized in the
   introduction are ignored and the authors continue the tradition of
   comparing patterns using different tools. How will this move research
   forward? The methodological approach was puzzling. Regardless, evidence
   in support of instrument quality needs to be expanded as it is
   inappropriate to interpret measures unless there is a robust body of
   evidence supporting them (see Mead et al. Evolution Education Outreach
   on instrument quality in evolution education). Please report comparable
   evidence types for the instrument.”

   Answer: The issue of comparison was already addressed (see above). In
   addition, we state clearly that our instrument was based on previous
   ones, and not exactly a brand new one, although we did not use Likert
   scale.

   L-“ The sampling methods should include information on missing data and
   whether it was missing at random (e.g., did students of particular
   groups have disproportionate missing data?). The participation rate
   should be mentioned in the main text.”

   Answer: This criticism was, in fact, the most profound and challenging
   one. Our database was searched on five occasions, including the
   doctoral thesis of a specialist in statistics, who studied precisely
   the existing clusters. However, as it is a relatively large database,
   at least in the context of the ROSE Project, the groupings always
   present overlaps that do not allow to figure out so clearly the image
   revealed by the MCA study, focusing on the same religion in the two
   countries. It led us to perform the easy-to-understand numerical
   calculations that resulted in the polygon image. Although we had no
   evidence that the missing cases could be biased, it was necessary to
   carry out a specific study. Thus, a new analysis of the database was
   performed and, now, we can categorically state that there are no
   elements that indicate any bias in the missing cases of the MCA. A new
   set of tables was added to Supplemental Materials (S2 File). A
   paragraph with the conclusion of the analysis was included and reads:

   “The detailed analysis of the occurrence of missing values allows us to
   conclude that there is no indication that the MCA results have any
   significant bias when comparing the responses of valid active cases
   with those with missing values.”

   We included the participation rate in the main text, and kept the
   summary and matrix of the MCA as supplementary materials. We are very
   grateful for the observation, which disturbed our sleep for a few days,
   but which, in the end, made our conclusions more solid.

   M-“The data have clear nesting and HLM (hierarchical linear models)
   would allow for the analyses of patterns within schools, regions, and
   countries. The current methodological approach is very unusual and so a
   rationale is needed for why MCA was used.”

   Answer: As mentioned in the previous answer, usual tests were performed
   on five doctoral theses, which resulted in several articles. However,
   it was not clear that the differences between Roman Catholic students
   from the two countries could be greater than the differences between
   them and Non-Catholic Christian denominations in the same country.

   N-“Why were the data on nationality and religion used to code responses
   when it would be possible to use predictor variables contained within
   the dataset? In other words, the analyses ignore the richness of the
   dataset and predispose the results to the coding scheme. This is
   problematic and poorly justified. Within- and between- group variation
   can be modeled along with interactions.”

   Answer: As mentioned in the previous answers, the richness of the data
   was studied in five doctoral theses, which resulted in several
   articles. One of them (Ocampo & Tolentino Neto, 2020) found different
   typologies of students, which were determined based on the hierarchical
   clustering method. However, the isolation of country and religion from
   the acceptance of evolution was yet to be done. Possibly, the results
   published by research groups from different countries, after our data
   collection, and the growth of conservative and anti-evolutionist
   influence, mainly in Brazil, have been decisive to emphasize the need
   for this particular study.

   O-“The discussion section should emphasize why these results matter.
   Let’s say that the results are well supported by evidence (which is by
   no means clear). How does this change how biologists should approach
   the challenge of evolution education? What are the implications for
   other countries? How should sociocultural factors be measured and
   included in models of acceptance? The discussion section should also
   include prior evolution education research in non-religious contexts
   such as China and other international studies (please review Donnelly
   and Deniz Springer and other studies).”

   Answer: We included new references, but could not include the mentioned
   article (probably Deniz, Donnelly and Yilmaz, 2008), where authors
   discuss other components in someone’s conceptual ecology for biological
   evolution. We believe we pointed out several implications of our
   results, including revising databanks and methodological aspects
   regarding items construction exploring factual scientific statements
   about biological evolution.
