Large moons are still significant for evolution

   Published 16 January 2019

   From Guy Cox, St Albans, New South Wales, Australia

   Eric Kvaalen notes the sun's contribution to tides on Earth (Letters,
   15 December 2018), in response to my letter on the importance of lunar
   tides to life moving from the oceans to land (3 November 2018). With
   respect, I didn't suggest that there would be no tides on Earth without
   our large moon. But the moon is the major determinant of our tides.

   Large tides may have allowed life to move onto land despite the
   advantages of the ocean: narrower temperature range, no risk of
   dehydration, little need for strong skeletons, and so on. If we ever do
   find intelligent life elsewhere, I still predict it will be aquatic.
