Epigenetics and evolution: ‘the significant biological puzzle’ of sexual
orientation

   The ‘gay gene’ some touted as explaining widespread homosexuality in
   humans has not been found. Might epigenetics hold the answer?

   Last century, when things were a whole lot worse for gay people than
   they are today, there was a widely held notion that human homosexual
   behaviour was a choice, and that a homosexual person could change their
   ways and become heterosexual. For this reason, the occasional report of
   a “gay” gene was welcomed by many progressive people. The existence of
   such genes would show that homosexuality was not a choice but an
   inevitable consequence of development and genetics. Indeed, gay genes
   were perhaps the only example where many left-leaning people heartily
   embraced genetic determinism.

   Awkwardly, like cold fusion, reports of genes that “cause” human
   homosexuality (and many other human behaviours) have failed to stand up
   to scrutiny – there is no “gay gene” in the sense that no one has
   identified genetic markers or genes that reliably predict sexual
   orientation in humans. Moreover, since homosexuality would generally be
   reckoned to reduce reproductive output of an individual, an allele (a
   gene variant) that directly causes homosexuality is unlikely to spread
   in a population.

     Epigenetic inheritance remains a tantalising possibility

   Nonetheless, human homosexuality in both sexes is widespread, as it is
   across the animal kingdom. One study estimated that 3.2% of the
   Australian human population identifies as gay or lesbian, a frequency
   that is typical across the world. Despite the lack of genetic markers
   that are predictive of human homosexuality, the trait is highly
   heritable in the sense that siblings are more similar in their sexual
   orientation than expected by chance. However, the level of concordance
   between identical twins is surprisingly low.

   Here’s an anecdotal example. I once had a friend who was the president
   of Gay Liberation in Victoria as a young man during the 1970s. “Fred”,
   now deceased, had a prominent scar on his forehead, a legacy of being
   beaten up in a country town where he had been invited to speak about
   his cause. (The burghers of the town were waiting to pick him up at the
   station, with evil intent.) Yet Fred’s identical twin was not gay. So
   much for genetic determinism. If homosexuality was solely genetically
   determined, identical twins should have identical sexual orientation.

   The widespread occurrence of homosexuality in humans and other animals,
   together with its high heritability but unpredictable genetics and lack
   of genetic markers, is a significant biological puzzle. There are three
   leading hypotheses for the common existence of homosexuality in human
   populations, one based on kin selection, one on sexually antagonistic
   alleles, and one on epigenetic inheritance.

   Briefly, the kin selection idea is that a gene that promotes homosexual
   behaviour can spread in a population if homosexual people contribute
   significantly to the reproduction of close relatives. Although this
   idea is plausible, the lack of any genetic marker that is reliably
   associated with sexual orientation is a strong argument against it.

   The “antagonistic alleles” idea is that there are certain genes that
   are selected in different directions, that is, positively selected in
   males, but negatively selected in females and vice versa.
   Hypothetically, because no such gene has been identified, a gene that
   promotes testosterone production could be at a selective advantage in
   males if it promoted traits such as muscle development, risk taking,
   opposite-sex sexual attraction and increased sexual attractiveness to
   females. But if the same gene were expressed in the same way in females
   it might be disadvantageous for reciprocal reasons. This means that
   selection could pull in different directions in males and females,
   maintaining different gene variants in a population. By that I mean,
   gene variants that have different selective advantages in males and
   females can potentially coexist in a population because neither is
   unambiguously better. If so, sexual orientation may be more fluid than
   one might expect based on biological sex alone. (Well, “der”, I suspect
   you are now thinking, but please don’t shoot your even-handed
   messenger.)

   Finally, we have an epigenetic hypothesis. Epigenetics is the transfer
   of genetic information between generations, which is not coded in DNA.
   In most mammals, male sexual development is determined by SrY, a gene
   on the Y chromosome. SrY codes a protein that interacts with other
   genes to reverse the default development of an embryo’s gonads from an
   oestrogen-producing ovary into a testosterone-producing testis. Thus,
   the short story of mammalian sexual development is that if a foetus is
   bathed in oestrogen produced by its default ovaries, it develops a
   female body. But if it is bathed in testosterone from its newly
   converted testes, it develops as a male.

   Well, that’s a nice cut-and-dried story of genetic determinism, isn’t
   it?

   I cheerfully taught it in my first-year biology classes for more than
   two decades, in full knowledge that the story is more complex. For
   example, if an individual’s testosterone production is defective, a
   genetic male (based on their possession of a Y chromosome and SrY gene)
   will develop as a female. Indeed, such individuals may be hyper-female,
   since they do not produce or respond to testosterone, whereas genetic
   females do both.

   Even more extraordinary is a rare syndrome caused by a deficiency of
   the enzyme 5α-reductase. This enzyme converts testosterone to a more
   potent male-determining hormone. These kids, who are chromosomally
   male, are born with female-like genitalia and are often raised as
   girls. They then change to the male phenotype at puberty with its
   associated release of testosterone. Not only do male foetuses produce
   more androgens than female foetuses, they respond to it more strongly
   due to sex-specific epigenetic marks in genes that code for androgen
   receptors. Conversely, female foetuses produce less androgen and have
   reduced responsiveness to it. It is even possible for a genetically
   female foetus to have levels of circulating androgens in the male range
   but still develop as a female. So, while the primary cause of male
   bodies from female bodies is indeed SrY, other genes on the sex
   chromosomes can modify its effects.

   The epigenetic hypothesis for the widespread occurrence of human
   homosexuality is based on the possibility of epigenetic inheritance of
   adjustments to a foetus’s testosterone sensitivity. Like most other
   epigenetic marks, sex-specific epigenetic marks are established anew in
   the early embryo following fertilisation.

   Thus, most of the sex-specific epigenetic marks on genes that are
   involved in testosterone sensitivity are scrubbed off and
   re-established in a reliably sex-specific pattern well before the
   gonads become differentiated into either testes or ovaries. However,
   not all epigenetic marks are completely erased during embryo
   development, and it is therefore possible that there is some
   transgenerational transfer of epigenetic settings for testosterone
   sensitivity. This could affect sexual phenotype, sexual identity and
   sexual attraction.

   This is a potentially important idea because it may explain the strong
   tendency for twins to have similar sexual preferences, but for this
   tendency to be no stronger between identical twins than it is between
   non-identical twins. This suggests epigenetic inheritance from one or
   other parent, but not genetic inheritance. If it were solely genetic,
   we would expect identical twins to be much more likely to share their
   sexual preferences than non-identical twins.

   So, to the extent to which human homosexuality is the question,
   epigenetic inheritance remains a tantalising possibility.
