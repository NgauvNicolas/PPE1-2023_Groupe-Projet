Human evolution

   The story of human evolution begins in Africa 7 million years ago

   The road to humanity was a long one, and we are still exploring its
   byways. It began in Africa some 7 million years ago when our lineage
   split from that of our closest living relatives the chimpanzees. Our
   ancestors still resembled apes nearly 4 millions years later. This
   includes Lucy, a 3.2-million-year-old human ancestor discovered in
   Ethiopia, from a group called the australopiths. In some ways Lucy was
   very ape-like: she had a chimp-sized brain and long arms that suggest
   she spent a lot of time in trees. But she also walked on two legs, like
   modern humans.

   Hominins living at this time probably made simple stone tools, but our
   ancestors didn’t really begin to look and behave like us until about
   1.9 million years ago with the appearance of the genus Homo. Homo
   erectus fossils have been found in Europe and Asia, marking it out as
   the first hominin to make its way out of Africa. It produced far more
   sophisticated tools than its predecessors, and was probably also the
   first hominin to control fire. Some researchers believe it invented
   cooking, providing them with more energy to allow bigger brains to
   evolve.

   However, the anatomy of Homo erectus suggests it was incapable of
   speech. That talent most likely came with Homo heidelbergensis, which
   evolved from Homo erectus in Africa about 600,000 years ago.
   Populations of Homo heidelbergensis living in Eurasia are thought to
   have given rise to the Neanderthals in the west and an enigmatic group
   called the Denisovans in the east. And was it was considered to be our
   direct ancestor too. However, new evidence is completely rewriting this
   part of the human story.

   Until recently, the out-of-Africa paradigm had Homo sapiens evolving in
   East Africa around 150,000 years ago, becoming capable of modern
   behaviours around 60,000 years ago, and then migrating en masse to
   colonise the entire world. But new analyses of fossils, tools and DNA
   tell a different story. It looks like our species is far older – at
   least 300,000 years old – and was behaviourally sophisticated from the
   start. We did evolve in Africa but, rather than originating in one
   region, we emerged from populations across the continent in a process
   called “African multiregionalism”. Everything, from the identity of our
   last ancestor, when our species left Africa and what happened next, is
   up for revision. These are interesting times to be exploring the human
   story – no doubt, there will be more plot twists to come.
