Ground-breaking collaborative social science

   At the School of Human Evolution and Social Change, we seek to
   understand the origins and implications of our human uniqueness – such
   as culture, cooperation and complexity. We combine the skills and
   perspectives of the largest anthropology and global health programs in
   the nation with smaller, hand-crafted ones in environmental social
   science, museum studies and applied math. Our energetic collaborations
   within and beyond our school are redefining social science as key to
   solving our most pressing and immediate human challenges – like
   disease, conflict and declining resources. We are also very proud to be
   training the next generation of extraordinary leaders for academia and
   beyond.

Our school by the numbers

   No. 1 in the U.S. for research expenditures in anthropology

   Our collections comprise nearly 2 million specimens

   We house 40+ labs devoted to a range of subjects, from geoarchaeology
   to genetics
