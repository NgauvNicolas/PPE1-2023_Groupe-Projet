Unraveling the evolutionary origins of umami and sweet taste preferences

   by Kindai University
   Unraveling the evolutionary origins of umami and sweet taste
   preferences A new study led by researchers from Kindai University
   identified five new groups of umami and sweet taste receptors within
   the TAS1R family (TAS1R 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) and also diversity in TAS1R2
   and TAS1R3 genes. Credit: Hidenori Nishihara from Kindai University

   The perception of taste is one of the most important senses and helps
   us identify beneficial foods and avoid harmful substances. For
   instance, our fondness for sweet and savory foods results from our need
   to consume carbohydrates and proteins. Given their importance as an
   evolutionary trait, researchers around the world are investigating how
   taste receptors originated and evolved over a period of time. Obtaining
   these insights into the feeding behavior of organisms can help them
   paint a picture of the history of life on Earth.

   One of the important tastes in our taste palette is umami, or the
   savory taste, which is associated with proteins that form a vital part
   of the diets of many organisms. The taste receptor type 1 (T1R) detects
   sweet and umami tastes among mammals. This taste receptor is encoded by
   the TAS1R, a family of genes, including TAS1R1, TAS1R2, and TAS1R3, and
   comes from a common ancestor of bony vertebrates.

   However, this gene pattern is not observed in coelacanth and
   cartilaginous fishes, where "taxonomically unplaced" TAS1R genes have
   been identified, suggesting an incomplete understanding of the
   evolutionary history of taste receptors.

   Now, however, a research team led by Associate Professor Hidenori
   Nishihara from Kindai University and Professor Yoshiro Ishimaru from
   Meiji University, Japan, have identified five new, previously
   undiscovered groups within the TAS1R family. This discovery is a result
   of a genome-wide survey of jawed vertebrates including all major fish
   groups.

   The study, published in Nature Ecology & Evolution on December 13,
   2023, includes the contributions of Senior Assistant Professor Yasuka
   Toda from Meiji University, Professor Masataka Okabe from The Jikei
   University School of Medicine, Professor Shigehiro Kuraku from the
   National Institute of Genetics, and Project Associate Professor Shinji
   Okada from The University of Tokyo.

   "Our study revealed that as compared to most modern vertebrates, the
   vertebrate ancestor possessed more T1Rs. These findings challenge the
   paradigm that only three T1R family members have been retained during
   evolution," says Prof. Nishihara.

   members. Filled, colored circles on the branches indicate the presence
   of the TAS1R members, whereas open circles indicate their absence.

   The novel taste receptor genes, named TAS1R4, TAS1R5, TAS1R6, TAS1R7,
   and TAS1R8 by the researchers, were categorized based on their
   distribution among species with a common ancestor. The researchers
   found TAS1R4 genes to be present in lizards, axolotl, lungfishes,
   coelacanth, bichir, and cartilaginous fishes, but absent in mammals,
   birds, crocodilians, turtles, and teleost fishes. In addition, axolotl,
   lungfishes, and coelacanth were found to have TAS1R5.

   The researchers observed a close evolutionary relationship between
   TAS1R5, TAS1R1, and TAS1R2, indicating a shared ancestry between these
   genes. The cartilaginous fishes possess TAS1R6 exclusively. Notably,
   the researchers found that TAS1R6 evolved from the same ancestral gene
   that led to TAS1R1, TAS1R2, and TAS1R5 genes. While axolotl and lizards
   possess TAS1R7, bichir and lungfishes possess TAS1R8. The researchers
   determined that these two genes originated in the common ancestor of
   jawed vertebrates.

   In addition to these new genes, the study revealed diversity in the
   existing TAS1R genes. For instance, they found that TAS1R3 of bony
   vertebrates could be divided into TAS1R3A and TAS1R3B. TAS1R3A was
   present in tetrapods and lungfishes, while TAS1R3B was identified in
   amphibians, lungfishes, coelacanths, and ray-finned fishes.
   Additionally, the genome survey found TAS1R2 to have diversified into
   two distinct groups (TAS1R2A and TAS1R2B), challenging the conventional
   idea that TAS1R2 forms a single gene group.

   "We found that the TAS1R phylogenetic tree comprises of a total of 11
   TAS1R clades, revealing an unexpected gene diversity," adds Prof.
   Nishihara.

   The findings also suggest that the first TAS1R gene appeared in jawed
   vertebrates around 615â€“473 million years ago. The gene then underwent
   several duplications to produce nine taste receptor genes (TAS1R1,2A,
   2B, 3A, 3B, 4, 5, 7, and 8) in the common ancestor of bony vertebrates.
   Over time, some of these genes were lost in different lineages, with
   mammals and teleosts retaining only three TAS1Rs (TAS1R1, TAS1R2A, and
   TAS1R3A in mammals).

   In addition to shedding light on the evolutionary history, the findings
   also have practical applications. Explaining these to us, Prof.
   Nishihara says, "These findings make it easier for us to deduce the
   taste preferences of diverse vertebrates. This, in turn, can have
   potential applications such as the development of pet foods and
   attractants tailored to the preferences of fish, amphibians, and
   reptiles."
