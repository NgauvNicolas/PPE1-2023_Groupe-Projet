Abstract

   OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has
   provided continual support for the Georgia Clinical and Translational
   Science Alliance (CTSA) since 2006. An overarching goal of the Georgia
   CTSA is to accelerate clinical and translational research to impact
   health in Georgia and beyond. Toward these ends, a primary objective
   has been to support interdisciplinary research projects encompassing 2
   or more disciplinary domains. The goal of the present study is to
   evaluate the degree to which interdisciplinary research projects
   increased in prevalence during the first decade of funding.
   METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We began by using PubMed to identify all
   publications citing the Georgia CTSA hub (n=1865), categorizing each
   article as encompassing 1 or more research domain using a taxonomy
   derived from the Web of Science. We created 1 network for each of the
   10 years with nodes representing research areas and ties between pairs
   of nodes representing the presence of 1 or more publication integrating
   both research areas. We conducted longitudinal network analyses using
   an approach called MCMC MLE Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models,
   which models the antecedents of networks over time. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED
   RESULTS: Supporting Georgia CTSA objectives, results suggest the
   probability of publications connecting multiple research areas
   increased over time, with substantially greater increases appearing
   initially as compared to later years. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF
   IMPACT: This study advances an innovative approach to modeling the
   system-wide impact of CTSA hub funding.
