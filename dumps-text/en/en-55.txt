8 Science Articles on Evolution

   Evolution is a cornerstone of middle and high school biology curricula,
   but it is sometimes hard to find clear and well-designed research
   examples that students can easily understand. This collection of
   adapted research articles provides students with approachable,
   empirical evidence of evolution at work in our world. Engage students
   with standards-matched adaptations, introductory video content,
   comprehension questions, and vocabulary to further your lesson
   outcomes. Each adapted article also comes with additional suggestions
   for activities to enhance student understanding and make class more
   exciting.

1. What can tree frogs in Chernobyl tell us about radiation?

   Abstract: Have you ever heard of Chernobyl? It was a nuclear power
   plant that released large amounts of radiation into the environment
   after an accident. While the people nearby left the area, the wildlife
   remained. Many plants and animals died because of the high levels of
   radiation. But others, such as tree frogs, adapted. We collected tree
   frogs from different areas surrounding the Chernobyl power plant. We
   analyzed their skin coloration. We found that the frogs closer to the
   power plant had darker skin coloration. That’s because they have higher
   levels of melanin. Melanin is known to protect organisms from
   radiation. We think that darker colored frogs better survived the
   higher levels of radiation closer to the power plant.

   This article is suitable for middle school and lower high school
   students, and is available in Spanish translation. It includes a Lesson
   Idea video and an Audio Edition narrating the adapted article.
     * Key terms: radioactivity, natural selection
     * Scientific figures: bar graph
     * Scientific methods: experiment, field study, observation,
       representative sampling

2. Evolution in action: are voles shrinking?

   Abstract: It is not easy being small. Especially when nature seems to
   favor larger individuals. But why don’t all animals evolve to be
   bigger? We studied a wild population of snow voles (a small rodent
   species) in their alpine habitat. Genetic analysis indicated a hidden
   evolutionary change: voles evolved to become smaller but the average
   body size of the population stayed the same. To understand the
   underlying causes, we separated genetic and environmental influences on
   vole body size. We found that young voles with genes for small bodies
   developed faster. This allowed them to survive better when
   environmental conditions changed (earlier arrival of winter). As a
   result, the population evolved towards a smaller body size. Our study
   shows that populations can evolve rapidly. But without a genetic
   perspective and understanding the underlying causes, we may not be able
   to detect these changes.

   This article is suitable for high school students.
     * Key terms: climate change, natural selection
     * Scientific figures: bar graph, line graph
     * Scientific methods: experiment, scientific modeling

3. How will dragonflies adapt to a warmer Earth?

   Abstract: The Earth is getting warmer, and we can see the effects of it
   – destructive floods, severe droughts, and intense storms. Just as we
   must look for ways to adjust to our changing environment, animals and
   plants must also adapt if they want to survive. We wanted to know how
   animals’ reproductive traits change to help them survive in warmer
   climates. We looked at dragonflies because the males use dark coloring
   on their wings to attract mates and intimidate rivals. We created a
   database to compare dragonflies living in warm climates to those living
   in cooler climates. We found that male dragonflies living in warmer
   climates have less wing coloring than those living in cooler climates.
   We also found wing ornamentation in warmer areas to be lighter in
   color. This is because the darker coloring can overheat the dragonfly
   and they become unable to reproduce. Lighter or reduced ornamentation
   is naturally selected when climates are warmer.

   This article is available in both UPPER and LOWER reading levels, and
   is suitable for middle school and high school students. It includes an
   extensive Lesson Plan.
     * Key terms: adaptation, climate change
     * Scientific figures: line graph
     * Scientific methods: climate scenarios, observation

4. What can fossils tell us about the nervous system’s evolution?

   Abstract: What can we learn from fossils? We can estimate the shape and
   size of an extinct animal. Anything else? Well, if soft tissues (like
   the brain or muscles) fossilize, it could tell us how the animal
   functioned or behaved. Unfortunately, soft tissue decomposes quickly
   after an animal dies. They aren’t preserved as fossils very often.
   That’s why we felt really lucky when we came across a fossil of an
   extinct horseshoe crab with a preserved central nervous system (CNS).
   We discovered that the organization of the CNS in our fossil is the
   same as in horseshoe crabs living today. It hasn’t changed in over 300
   million years! We also figured out how our unique fossil might have
   formed. This could help others discover similar fossils in the future.

   This article is suitable for middle school and lower high school
   students. It includes a Lesson Idea video, and an Ask-A-Scientist
   interview with the original researcher.
     * Key terms: fossils, neuroscience, paleontology
     * Scientific figures: pictograph
     * Scientific methods: microscopy, observation

5. Where did flying reptiles come from?

   Abstract: Have you heard of flying dinosaurs named pterodactyls
   [terr-oh-dak-tlz]? Well, you may be surprised to hear that they are not
   technically dinosaurs. Pterodactyls, part of the group pterosaurs
   [terr-oh-sorz], were reptiles. They were related to dinosaurs, which
   are also reptiles, but do not belong to that group. Pterosaurs were the
   first vertebrates that were able to fly by flapping their wings. This
   makes them all the more interesting. Have you ever thought about how it
   is possible that some animals started to fly? How did they get their
   wings? The general answer is: evolution. But here the mystery deepens.
   For a long time it seemed like there was a huge evolutionary gap
   between pterosaurs and most other animals. How did they come about? By
   looking at fossils, we found out that lagerpetids [la-jer-pe-tids] (a
   small group of non-flying reptiles) are close relatives of pterosaurs.
   Finding out about lagerpetids told us a bit about how pterosaurs
   started to fly.

   This article is suitable for middle school and lower high school
   students. It includes an extensive Lesson Plan with slides about
   evolution.
     * Key terms: fossils, dinosaurs, reptiles, paleontology
     * Scientific figures: pictograph
     * Scientific methods: experiment, tomography scans, X-ray scanner

6. Why can some monkeys live high in the mountains?

   Abstract: Geladas are an unusual primate. They eat mostly grass instead
   of fruit or meat. They are known as “bleeding heart monkeys” for the
   bright red patch of skin on their chests. They also live high in the
   mountains instead of in the jungle or the savanna. The air is thinner
   high in the mountains, so it is harder to get enough oxygen. How can
   geladas thrive in that environment? That’s what we wanted to find
   out. We studied the DNA of wild geladas. We found a surprising
   difference in how DNA is packaged between geladas from two different
   regions of Ethiopia. Also, we know that some animals react to low
   oxygen by increasing the amount of hemoglobin in their blood. But we
   learned that geladas don’t do that. Instead, they might have evolved to
   have larger lungs to help them get more oxygen with each breath.

   This article is suitable for high school students. It includes a Lesson
   Idea video.
     * Key terms: genetics, species distribution
     * Scientific figures: map, scatter plot
     * Scientific methods: DNA sequencing, experiment

7. Why do some clownfish not breed?

   Abstract: Clownfish are one of the most well-known tropical fish. But
   even though we see them on our TV screens, what do you know about them
   in real life? They live in social groups in which individuals are
   ranked by size (size-based dominance hierarchy). The two biggest
   dominant individuals breed (have babies), but the smaller individuals
   do not. So why do some clownfish forgo their own reproduction? We
   decided to investigate the smaller clownfish. We looked at the risks
   and rewards of moving to a different home to breed or of contesting to
   breed in their current home. We found that it’s too risky for these
   clownfish to move to a new home. Furthermore, they aren’t likely to
   contest by getting bigger and potentially fight the dominants since
   they risk being evicted from the group. So, they choose to stay put and
   wait in the hope that they will one day be able to breed.

   This article is suitable for middle school students. It includes an
   Ask-A-Scientist interview with the original researcher.
     * Key terms: animal behavior, genetics
     * Scientific figures: pictograph
     * Scientific methods: experiment, field study, observation

8. Why do sharks sleep?

   Abstract: We all know what it feels like when we have not had enough
   sleep. You might feel tired, have trouble concentrating, or even be
   grumpy and irritable. Despite it being such an important part of our
   daily lives, sleep still remains a bit of a mystery! To help answer the
   question of why we sleep, scientists have started researching sleep in
   other animals. This can help us understand how and why sleep evolved.
   Sharks are hundreds of millions of years old. In fact, they are the
   oldest living group of jawed vertebrates! Because of this, we think
   they could help unlock important information about the evolution of
   sleep. We studied the metabolic rate and behavior of draughtsboard
   sharks (Cephaloscyllium isabellum) over a 24-hour period. Our results
   show that when sharks sleep, they typically have a flat body posture
   and a reduced metabolic rate. Our study supports the hypothesis that
   the conservation of energy is a core function of sleep. It also
   provides insight into its evolution.

   This article is available in both UPPER and LOWER reading levels, and
   is suitable for elementary school, middle school and lower high school
   students. It includes a Lesson Idea video.
     * Key terms: animal behavior, metabolism
     * Scientific figures: bar graph, pictograph
     * Scientific methods: experiment, observation
