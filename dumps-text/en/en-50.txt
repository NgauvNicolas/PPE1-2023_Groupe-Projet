Natural selection

   The process by which some organisms in a population survive and
   reproduce, while others do not, based on their bodies and behaviour

   Natural selection is the process by which some organisms in a
   population survive and reproduce, while others do not, based on their
   bodies and behaviour. It is one of the processes by which species
   change from generation to generation, and is a crucial element of the
   theory of evolution.

   A classic example of natural selection at work is the origin of
   giraffes’ long necks. The ancestors of modern giraffes were animals
   similar to deer or antelope, with necks of ordinary length. However,
   because the trees in their habitat were tall, those giraffes with
   slightly longer necks had an advantage over their shorter-necked
   fellows. The longer-necked giraffes reproduced more, so in the next
   generation longer necks were more common. Over many generations this
   process produced giraffes as they are today.

   This process of natural selection was first described by Charles Darwin
   in 1859 in On the Origin of Species. It helps explain how the many
   varied species on Earth could be descended from a single ancestral
   species.

   Natural selection is sometimes summed up as “survival of the fittest”.
   This is true but can be misleading. The word “fittest” does not
   necessarily refer to physical fitness. Rather, it means how well-suited
   an organism is to its environment and lifestyle. The fittest organisms
   are not necessarily the fastest or strongest: often they are the most
   cooperative.

   Natural selection can produce surprising results. It can produce more
   complex organisms, for example creating multicellular organisms from
   single-celled ones, but it can also simplify: for example, fish species
   that live in dark caves lose their eyes. Furthermore, when
   circumstances change natural selection can swiftly reverse course.

   However, natural selection has its limits. In particular, because it is
   not guided by a consciousness, it has no foresight and can lead species
   to evolve down paths that seem advantageous but actually lead to
   extinction.

   There is also more to evolution than natural selection. Species can
   change in a more undirected way by a process called genetic drift, in
   which certain genetic variants become more common despite not having
   any particular advantage. When a species is not under strong selection,
   genes can vary more freely and this sometimes leads to the emergence of
   remarkable new traits. There is also sexual selection, in which animals
   choose their potential mates not because of their actual fitness, but
   on the basis of showy ornaments like peacock’s tails or complex songs.
   Finally, many organisms have cultural behaviours such as tool use, and
   these feed back onto traditional evolutionary processes like natural
   selection.

   Evolution is also chaotic, meaning that the changes it produces are not
   always predictable. This is partly because it relies on random
   mutations to produce the raw material on which natural selection can
   act. More controversially, it has been argued that natural selection
   has a kind of memory that allows it to swiftly recreate old solutions
   when they are needed.

   Nowadays there is also a new force in evolution: humans. We are
   exerting new selection pressures on many species, changing them in
   unpredictable ways.
