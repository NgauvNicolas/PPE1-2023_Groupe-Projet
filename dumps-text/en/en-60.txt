Evolution might stop humans from solving climate change, researchers say

   by Marcus Wolf, University of Maine
   Evolution might stop humans from solving climate change, says new study
   Dimensions of environmental management create an attractor landscape
   for long-term human evolution. Environmental sustainability challenges
   (curved frontiers) require a minimum level of cooperation in a society
   of a certain minimum spatial size. Alternative potential paths move
   humanity toward different long-term evolutionary outcomes. In path B,
   competition between societies over common environmental resources
   creates cultural selection between groups for increasingly direct
   competition and conflict. Path A, growing cooperation between societies
   facilitates the emergence of global cultural traits to preserve shared
   environmental benefits. Credit: Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
   Society B: Biological Sciences (2023). DOI: 10.1098/rstb.2022.0259

   Central features of human evolution may stop our species from resolving
   global environmental problems like climate change, says a recent study
   led by the University of Maine.

   Humans have come to dominate the planet with tools and systems to
   exploit natural resources that were refined over thousands of years
   through the process of cultural adaptation to the environment.
   University of Maine evolutionary biologist Tim Waring wanted to know
   how this process of cultural adaptation to the environment might
   influence the goal of solving global environmental problems. What he
   found was counterintuitive.

   The project sought to understand three core questions: how human
   evolution has operated in the context of environmental resources, how
   human evolution has contributed to the multiple global environmental
   crises, and how global environmental limits might change the outcomes
   of human evolution in the future.

   Waring's team outlined their findings in a new paper published in
   Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. Other authors of the
   study include Zach Wood, UMaine alumni, and Eörs Szathmáry, a professor
   at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary.

Human expansion

   The study explored how human societies' use of the environment changed
   over our evolutionary history. The research team investigated changes
   in the ecological niche of human populations, including factors such as
   the natural resources they used, how intensively they were used, what
   systems and methods emerged to use those resources and the
   environmental impacts that resulted from their usage.
   [INS: :INS]

   This effort revealed a set of common patterns. Over the last 100,000
   years, human groups have progressively used more types of resources,
   with more intensity, at greater scales and with greater environmental
   impacts. Those groups often then spread to new environments with new
   resources.

   The global human expansion was facilitated by the process of cultural
   adaptation to the environment. This leads to the accumulation of
   adaptive cultural traits—social systems and technology to help exploit
   and control environmental resources such as agricultural practices,
   fishing methods, irrigation infrastructure, energy technology and
   social systems for managing each of these.

   "Human evolution is mostly driven by cultural change, which is faster
   than genetic evolution. That greater speed of adaptation has made it
   possible for humans to colonize all habitable land worldwide," says
   Waring, associate professor with the UMaine Senator George J. Mitchell
   Center for Sustainability Solutions and the School of Economics.

   Moreover, this process accelerates because of a positive feedback
   process: as groups get larger, they accumulate adaptive cultural traits
   more rapidly, which provides more resources and enables faster growth.

   "For the last 100,000 years, this has been good news for our species as
   a whole." Waring says, "but this expansion has depended on large
   amounts of available resources and space."

   Today, humans have also run out of space. We have reached the physical
   limits of the biosphere and laid claim to most of the resources it has
   to offer. Our expansion also is catching up with us. Our cultural
   adaptations, particularly the industrial use of fossil fuels, have
   created dangerous global environmental problems that jeopardize our
   safety and access to future resources.

Global limits

   To see what these findings mean for solving global challenges like
   climate change, the research team looked at when and how sustainable
   human systems emerged in the past. Waring and his colleagues found two
   general patterns. First, sustainable systems tend to grow and spread
   only after groups have struggled or failed to maintain their resources
   in the first place.

   For example, the U.S. regulated industrial sulfur and nitrogen dioxide
   emissions in 1990, but only after we had determined that they caused
   acid rain and acidified many water bodies in the Northeast. This
   delayed action presents a major problem today as we threaten other
   global limits. For climate change, humans need to solve the problem
   before we cause a crash.

   Second, researchers also found evidence that strong systems of
   environmental protection tend to address problems within existing
   societies, not between them. For example, managing regional water
   systems requires regional cooperation, regional infrastructure and
   technology, and these arise through regional cultural evolution. The
   presence of societies of the right scale is therefore a critical
   limiting factor.

   Tackling the climate crisis effectively will probably require new
   worldwide regulatory, economic and social systems—ones that generate
   greater cooperation and authority than existing systems like the Paris
   Agreement. To establish and operate those systems, humans need a
   functional social system for the planet, which we don't have.

   "One problem is that we don't have a coordinated global society which
   could implement these systems," says Waring, "We only have sub-global
   groups, which probably won't suffice. But you can imagine cooperative
   treaties to address these shared challenges. So, that's the easy
   problem."

   The other problem is much worse, Waring says. In a world filled with
   sub-global groups, cultural evolution among these groups will tend to
   solve the wrong problems, benefiting the interests of nations and
   corporations and delaying action on shared priorities. Cultural
   evolution among groups would tend to exacerbate resource competition
   and could lead to direct conflict between groups and even global human
   dieback.

   "This means global challenges like climate change are much harder to
   solve than previously considered," says Waring. "It's not just that
   they are the hardest thing our species has ever done. They absolutely
   are. The bigger problem is that central features in human evolution are
   likely working against our ability to solve them. To solve global
   collective challenges we have to swim upstream."

Looking forward

   Waring and his colleagues think that their analysis can help navigate
   the future of human evolution on a limited Earth. Their paper is the
   first to propose that human evolution may oppose the emergence of
   collective global problems and further research is needed to develop
   and test this theory.

   Waring's team proposes several applied research efforts to better
   understand the drivers of cultural evolution and search for ways to
   reduce global environmental competition, given how human evolution
   works. For example, research is needed to document the patterns and
   strength of human cultural evolution in the past and present. Studies
   could focus on the past processes that lead to the human domination of
   the biosphere, and on the ways cultural adaptation to the environment
   is occurring today.

   But if the general outline proves to be correct, and human evolution
   tends to oppose collective solutions to global environmental problems,
   as the authors suggest, then some very pressing questions need to be
   answered. This includes whether we can use this knowledge to improve
   the global response to climate change.

   "There is hope, of course, that humans may solve climate change. We
   have built cooperative governance before, although never like this: in
   a rush at a global scale," Waring says.

   The growth of international environmental policy provides some hope.
   Successful examples include the Montreal Protocol to limit
   ozone-depleting gases and the global moratorium on commercial whaling.

   New efforts should include fostering more intentional, peaceful and
   ethical systems of mutual self-limitation, particularly through market
   regulations and enforceable treaties, that bind human groups across the
   planet together ever more tightly into a functional unit.

   But that model may not work for climate change.

   "Our paper explains why and how building cooperative governance at the
   global scale is different, and helps researchers and policymakers be
   more clear-headed about how to work toward global solutions," says
   Waring.

   This new research could lead to a novel policy mechanism to address the
   climate crisis: Modifying the process of adaptive change among
   corporations and nations may be a powerful way to address global
   environmental risks.

   As for whether humans can continue to survive on a limited planet,
   Waring says, "We don't have any solutions for this idea of a long-term
   evolutionary trap, as we barely understand the problem. If our
   conclusions are even close to being correct, we need to study this much
   more carefully."
