Human evolution

   Human evolution is the lengthy process of change by which people
   originated from apelike ancestors. Scientific evidence shows that the
   physical and behavioral traits shared by all people originated from
   apelike ancestors and evolved over a period of approximately six
   million years.

   One of the earliest defining human traits, bipedalism -- the ability to
   walk on two legs -- evolved over 4 million years ago. Other important
   human characteristics -- such as a large and complex brain, the ability
   to make and use tools, and the capacity for language -- developed more
   recently. Many advanced traits -- including complex symbolic
   expression, art, and elaborate cultural diversity -- emerged mainly
   during the past 100,000 years.

   Humans are primates. Physical and genetic similarities show that the
   modern human species, Homo sapiens, has a very close relationship to
   another group of primate species, the apes. Humans and the great apes
   (large apes) of Africa -- chimpanzees (including bonobos, or so-called
   “pygmy chimpanzees”) and gorillas -- share a common ancestor that lived
   between 8 and 6 million years ago. Humans first evolved in Africa, and
   much of human evolution occurred on that continent. The fossils of
   early humans who lived between 6 and 2 million years ago come entirely
   from Africa.

   Most scientists currently recognize some 15 to 20 different species of
   early humans. Scientists do not all agree, however, about how these
   species are related or which ones simply died out. Many early human
   species -- certainly the majority of them – left no living descendants.
   Scientists also debate over how to identify and classify particular
   species of early humans, and about what factors influenced the
   evolution and extinction of each species.

   Early humans first migrated out of Africa into Asia probably between 2
   million and 1.8 million years ago. They entered Europe somewhat later,
   between 1.5 million and 1 million years. Species of modern humans
   populated many parts of the world much later. For instance, people
   first came to Australia probably within the past 60,000 years and to
   the Americas within the past 30,000 years or so. The beginnings of
   agriculture and the rise of the first civilizations occurred within the
   past 12,000 years.


Paleoanthropology

   Paleoanthropology is the scientific study of human evolution.
   Paleoanthropology is a subfield of anthropology, the study of human
   culture, society, and biology. The field involves an understanding of
   the similarities and differences between humans and other species in
   their genes, body form, physiology, and behavior. Paleoanthropologists
   search for the roots of human physical traits and behavior. They seek
   to discover how evolution has shaped the potentials, tendencies, and
   limitations of all people. For many people, paleoanthropology is an
   exciting scientific field because it investigates the origin, over
   millions of years, of the universal and defining traits of our species.
   However, some people find the concept of human evolution troubling
   because it can seem not to fit with religious and other traditional
   beliefs about how people, other living things, and the world came to
   be. Nevertheless, many people have come to reconcile their beliefs with
   the scientific evidence.

   Early human fossils and archeological remains offer the most important
   clues about this ancient past. These remains include bones, tools and
   any other evidence (such as footprints, evidence of hearths, or
   butchery marks on animal bones) left by earlier people. Usually, the
   remains were buried and preserved naturally. They are then found either
   on the surface (exposed by rain, rivers, and wind erosion) or by
   digging in the ground. By studying fossilized bones, scientists learn
   about the physical appearance of earlier humans and how it changed.
   Bone size, shape, and markings left by muscles tell us how those
   predecessors moved around, held tools, and how the size of their brains
   changed over a long time. Archeological evidence refers to the things
   earlier people made and the places where scientists find them. By
   studying this type of evidence, archeologists can understand how early
   humans made and used tools and lived in their environments.


The process of evolution

   The process of evolution involves a series of natural changes that
   cause species (populations of different organisms) to arise, adapt to
   the environment, and become extinct. All species or organisms have
   originated through the process of biological evolution. In animals that
   reproduce sexually, including humans, the term species refers to a
   group whose adult members regularly interbreed, resulting in fertile
   offspring -- that is, offspring themselves capable of reproducing.
   Scientists classify each species with a unique, two-part scientific
   name. In this system, modern humans are classified as Homo sapiens.

   Evolution occurs when there is change in the genetic material -- the
   chemical molecule, DNA -- which is inherited from the parents, and
   especially in the proportions of different genes in a population. Genes
   represent the segments of DNA that provide the chemical code for
   producing proteins. Information contained in the DNA can change by a
   process known as mutation. The way particular genes are expressed –
   that is, how they influence the body or behavior of an organism -- can
   also change. Genes affect how the body and behavior of an organism
   develop during its life, and this is why genetically inherited
   characteristics can influence the likelihood of an organism’s survival
   and reproduction.

   Evolution does not change any single individual. Instead, it changes
   the inherited means of growth and development that typify a population
   (a group of individuals of the same species living in a particular
   habitat). Parents pass adaptive genetic changes to their offspring, and
   ultimately these changes become common throughout a population. As a
   result, the offspring inherit those genetic characteristics that
   enhance their chances of survival and ability to give birth, which may
   work well until the environment changes. Over time, genetic change can
   alter a species' overall way of life, such as what it eats, how it
   grows, and where it can live. Human evolution took place as new genetic
   variations in early ancestor populations favored new abilities to adapt
   to environmental change and so altered the human way of life.

   evidence for human evolution, in the form of fossils and artifacts.
