How can evolution happen without external reality?

   Published 4 March 2020

   From Paul Mealing, Melbourne, Australia

   Your collection of articles on reality was informative (1 February, p
   39). Most provocative was Alison George reporting Donald Hoffman’s
   claim that nothing we perceive resembles reality and we are “born with
   a virtual reality headset on”. He says evolution gave us this to
   simplify things so we had “what we need to play the game of life”, and
   that what we perceive is an abstract data structure that represents
   something that “doesn’t even exist in space and time”. The implication
   that evolution therefore doesn’t occur in space and time creates
   problems for me. Hoffman goes on to say that evolution has shaped us to
   see things that we have to take seriously, to see what we need to stay
   alive, but that “does not, logically, permit us to say that we’re
   seeing the truth”.

   But evolution occurs by natural selection, which requires an
   environment for biological agents to interact with. Assuming that we
   are born with such a VR headset, the “data structure” it creates must
   surely closely resemble the external environment it interacts with in
   space and time – otherwise we wouldn’t survive.
