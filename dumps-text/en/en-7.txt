Online Support

     * First consult the Evolution Manual.
     * The evolution-users at lists.osuosl.org mailing list is the best
       place to seek further assistance with using Evolution, for example
       when you have problems. Subscribe here.
       Although you can also use GNOME Discourse (with the evolution tag),
       the mailing list may be preferable due to wider community
       participation.
     * Many Evolution developers and users can also be found on Libera
       Chat IRC, channel #gnome-evolution.
     * Bugs and feature requests can be filled under GNOME issue tracker,
       depending on the place of the issue, but it's fine when it's filled
       against other project, because issues can be moved between projects
       there. New issues can be filled in the GNOME GitLab instance,
       namely for evolution-data-server, evolution, evolution-ews and
       evolution-mapi. Always search it for any existing reports, even
       closed, to not create unnecessary duplicates. Also mention your
       versions, because it's possible that the issues had been already
       fixed (especially when Long Term Support distributions provide
       older versions).

Evolution in Flatpak

   Flathub contains the latest stable version. Users can build and run the
   latest stable (or development) Evolution in Flatpak, even on older
   distributions. A detailed guide can be found on the Evolution Flatpak
   sub-page.

Get the Source Code

   The Evolution project releases its source code as tarball files, from
   which Free Software distributors can create easily-installable binary
   packages for users.

   Most likely your Free Software distribution (Fedora, Mint, Ubuntu,
   etc.) already provides binary packages for Evolution. The following
   links are only for the source code.

   The latest stable releases are the 3.50 series. Tarballs can be found
   for these various components (see also the ".news" files accompanying
   them for a list of changes):
     * evolution 3.50.x
     * evolution-data-server 3.50.x
     * evolution-ews 3.50.x (optional, for Microsoft Exchange servers)
     * evolution-mapi 3.50.x (optional, for old Microsoft Exchange
       servers)

   The latest development snapshot tarballs (3.51 series, what will become
   3.52) can be found below (after the first 3.51 release):
     * evolution 3.51.x
     * evolution-data-server 3.51.x
     * evolution-ews 3.51.x (optional, for Microsoft Exchange servers)
     * evolution-mapi 3.51.x (optional, for old Microsoft Exchange
       servers)

   Or you can clone the source code repositories with git:
     * git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/evolution.git (Browse)
     * git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/evolution-data-server.git
       (Browse)
     * git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/evolution-ews.git
       (optional, for Microsoft Exchange servers) (Browse)
     * git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/evolution-mapi.git
       (optional, for old Microsoft Exchange servers) (Browse)
