Abstract

   In recent years, an extension of the Darwinian framework is being
   considered for the study of prebiotic chemical evolution, shifting the
   attention from homogeneous populations of naked molecular species to
   populations of heterogeneous, compartmentalized and functionally
   integrated assemblies of molecules. Several implications of this shift
   of perspective are analysed in this critical review, both in terms of
   the individual units, which require an adequate characterization as
   self-maintaining systems with an internal organization, and also in
   relation to their collective and long-term evolutionary dynamics, based
   on competition, collaboration and selection processes among those
   complex individuals. On these lines, a concrete proposal for the set of
   molecular control mechanisms that must be coupled to bring about
   autonomous functional systems, at the interface between chemistry and
   biology, is provided.
   Keywords: chemical evolution, natural selection, origins of life,
   autonomous functional systems, prebiotic systems chemistry

1. Introduction

   About a century and a half ago, in his book On the Origin of Species,
   Charles R. Darwin proposed natural selection (NS) as the main driving
   force that guides the evolution of species, conceived as a process of
   descent with modification from a common ancestor. Today we have
   overwhelming evidence to support that this process has been
   continuously shaping the living world over time on the Earth and, thus,
   it constitutes a central paradigm of biology. Darwinian evolution must
   have started, at the latest, with the first population of living cells,
   whose precise characteristics remain inaccessible to us, but whose
   descendants originated, among other putative lineages later extinct,
   the so-called last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [1]. Without
   excluding other important factors (e.g. genetic drift, gene flow,
   population size/structure effects, symbiotic and mutualistic
   relationships, lateral gene transfer and sex), past and current
   biodiversity is therefore regarded as the outcome of evolutionary
   dynamics based on NS from LUCA [2].

   Nevertheless, a big scientific riddle not yet resolved is what happened
   before the first self-reproducing cellular organisms appeared on Earth,
   likely between 3.8 and 3.5 billion years ago. Although biological
   systems consist of well-described sets of coupled chemical reactions,
   very little is known about the transition from inanimate matter to
   living entities, i.e. from the most complicated chemistry we can think
   of to the simplest biology. The majority of researchers in the field of
   origins of life have worked under the assumption that a population of
   self-replicating RNA (or RNA-like) molecules started competing for a
   limited amount of resources (i.e. nucleotides or analogous monomers) in
   their local environment, and some form of NS already began operating at
   that chemical level [3–5]. This widespread conception is supported by
   two breakthroughs from last half-century molecular biology: (i) the
   development of in vitro molecular evolution technologies, which allowed
   to prove that populations of biopolymers with template properties
   could, indeed, change in time under artificial selective pressure
   [6–9]; and (ii) the discovery of ribozymes [10,11], which demonstrated
   the catalytic capacities of RNAs and, thereby, the dual role that this
   type of macromolecule might have played at the onset of life.

   As a result, some researchers have conjectured on a possible link
   between the emerging concept of chemical evolution and the established
   notion of biological evolution, considered as two different stages of a
   common natural process of matter complexification [12–15]. Uncovering
   possible mechanisms of chemical evolution that include early or
   minimalist versions of NS would then be crucial to understand how life
   originated on Earth—or, eventually, in a different extraterrestrial
   environment. Computational and theoretical studies carried out in the
   last years support that chemical kinetics may become evolutionary
   dynamics in populations of self-replicating molecules, or in
   collectively autocatalytic networks [16–18]. The overall idea behind
   these studies is that the evolutionary potential of such chemical
   systems would result from an increase in their dynamic stability as a
   consequence of the copying process or the cross-catalytic effects among
   the molecules in the network.

   Several key questions remain open in this context, however. First, why
   is it so hard to find artificial chemistries that spontaneously
   converge into systems or phenomena of higher complexity and dynamic
   stability? Is it because experimental scientists are not finding the
   right precursors and boundary conditions? Or is it because there are
   ‘evolutionary bottlenecks’—still to be identified and
   characterized—that must be overcome to trigger off such a behaviour?
   Secondly, is ‘kinetic control’ (i.e. the rate of template copying or
   the catalytic power of the molecules) the only relevant aspect to
   ensure the necessary dynamic robustness of those prebiotic systems that
   would, eventually, lead to the onset of open-ended, biological
   evolution? If not, what other types of control mechanisms or basic
   functions should be taken into account at those initial stages? More
   precisely, regarding the emergence of Darwinian evolutionary dynamics,
   how large must a primary ‘functional/phenotypic space’ be for NS to get
   established, or become operational? And, finally, granted that cyclic
   chemical reaction networks are so important for the living, how could
   they be initially kept together, away from thermodynamic equilibrium
   for long enough, so that they may actually reproduce and become
   evolvable individuals?

   Questions like the previous ones were rarely asked in the field of
   origins of life 20 years ago, when different research schools were
   still fighting for the prebiotic plausibility of their preferred
   biopolymer (e.g. nucleic acid versus protein) or biochemical process
   (template replication versus metabolic pathways). However, after the
   advent of systems approaches in biology at the turn of the century
   [19–21], chemistry is also taking up the challenge of dealing with
   increasingly intricate combinations of molecules at once, under various
   conditions and making use of novel experimental set-ups and
   technologies [22–27], which opens new perspectives and opportunities
   for research on the origins of life [28–31]. In that context, figure 1
   introduces our view about the main stages and bottlenecks involved in
   the transition from chemical to biological evolution, with emphasis on
   the evolutionary importance of establishing efficient functional
   couplings within chemical systems, as we will argue in more detail
   below. Of course, chemical evolutionary pathways (bottom part of the
   figure) will surely cover a wider research area than those potentially
   conducive to prebiotic phenomena. Nevertheless, some of them should
   turn into legitimate candidates to bring about lifelike dynamic
   behaviours, perhaps by means of alternative components and processes to
   the ones actually implemented in our biosphere. Despite the expected
   difficulties in establishing the ‘liveliness’ of these intermediate
   chemical systems, the necessity to start integrating organizational and
   evolutionary accounts of those kinds of complex (pre-bio)molecular
   phenomena is becoming less and less controversial, and that is
   precisely the area on which we focus this short critical review or
   perspective article.

   Scheme of the different stages and bottlenecks that could have occurred
   during the transition from chemical to biological evolution. Among the
   complex and interacting chemical mixtures present on early Earth, only
   those that developed the first functional couplings were available for
   the next step of the overall process. Further diversification of those
   coupled systems made stronger functional integration mechanisms
   possible, leading to—at least—one type of system in the population with
   sufficient dynamic/structural stability to overcome the bottleneck
   imposed by the need for reliable reproduction (including molecular
   template mechanisms). This stage corresponded to systems in which
   compartment, metabolism and replication (CMR) were tightly coupled. In
   turn, only those CMR systems that became capable of open-ended
   biological evolution (see explanation in the text) would show the
   long-term robustness required to follow the pathway to LUCA and its
   further diversification into the three domains of life.

2. Merging systems chemistry and evolutionary theory

   It is turning increasingly apparent that evolutionary theory can no
   longer keep the ‘black box’ of individuality closed. In particular, the
   triad ‘multiplication, variation and heredity’ cannot be simply assumed
   as a general set of conditions that define any unit of selection [2],
   but needs to be more precisely specified, if it is to carry any
   descriptive/predictive power. In turn, those approaches that invoke
   physico-chemical forces (e.g. self-organization and self-assembly,
   spatial constraints and energetic couplings) to support mechanistic or
   physiological accounts for the development of chemical complexity on
   the way to biological phenomena should be made coherent with the
   Darwinian framework, which explains the dynamics taking place at a
   population level. Oversimplifications, imposing either the evolutionary
   framework (i.e. disregarding the internal complexity of the
   individuals) or the physiological/organizational one (i.e. disregarding
   the power of evolutionary mechanisms), have not worked satisfactorily
   [32,33]. Thus, the challenge for origins-of-life research is to make
   use of systems chemistry to identify and characterize mixtures of
   biomolecular precursors that could get coupled into individuals with
   capacity for self-maintenance and potential increase in complexity
   (i.e. ‘proto-organisms’, taken as assemblies of different chemical
   species with functional attributes—see below). In parallel, researchers
   should carefully examine the evolutionary consequences of having one
   type of individual or another in the population, in terms of the
   competitive and selective dynamics that take place at that collective
   level, within a plausible geochemical setting.

   Two additional arguments can be given to support the necessity of
   merging the new systems approach and evolutionary theory. First, all
   known living beings are made of highly diverse and intertwined
   components and transformation processes. Simplifying their origins to
   the dynamics of one type of molecular component is a strong and
   reductionist conjecture, which should not be taken for granted. Second,
   in order to turn operational and lead to systems of increasing
   complexity, evolution by NS should have required, from the beginning,
   individuals who provide a wide enough space to express a phenotypic
   variety [34,35]. For example, although molecular evolution through
   artificial selection for a given phenotype (e.g. a given aptamer or an
   engineered ribozyme) has been clearly demonstrated to take place
   without any need for such ‘composite individuals’ [6–9,36], it is
   becoming more and more obvious that molecules of a single kind, no
   matter their structural complexity, face intrinsic bottlenecks due to
   the fact that they do not offer the wide phenotypic space required for
   the emergence of autonomous functional systems. The alternative
   scenario here proposed is not straightforward, either. In particular,
   it requires a high degree of chemical diversity and heterogeneity from
   the beginning, an apparent complication that some other researchers
   have also supported, with different strength and motivations [37–40].
   However, this is bound to pay back soon in terms of the behavioural
   richness and evolutionary potential displayed by the more complex
   individuals that are drawn in the process. Somehow (as we explain in
   more detail in the sections below), reaching that initial threshold of
   complexity would make it possible, for chemical systems that overcome a
   first set of evolutionary bottlenecks (bottom part of figure 1) and
   keep relatively robust dynamics, to display a wide range of chemical
   couplings and functional behaviours that would allow them, in turn, to
   undergo further prebiotic transitions (in particular, to originate
   ternary systems denoted as ‘CMR’ in figure 1).

   On these lines, acknowledging the importance of the input provided by
   the RNA World theory (as it was proposed 30 years ago [41], but also,
   more interestingly, through the recent advances in the prebiotic
   synthesis of its precursor molecules [42–45] or the improved
   elaborations on the general hypotheses behind it—both theoretical
   [46–48] and experimental [49,50]), one should nevertheless accept that
   an important gap remains in our understanding of the processes that
   could have spontaneously supported the emergence, maintenance and
   evolutionary potential of such a precellular world. Especially, it must
   be noted that various chemical reactions traditionally involved in the
   artificial organic syntheses of RNA precursors are thermodynamically
   uphill or show high kinetic barriers in the absence of activating
   molecules or catalysts, respectively. It looks highly more probable
   that before (or at the same time as) biopolymers with functional
   capacities came to the stage, other (simpler) molecular species and
   structures (e.g. small, non-coded peptides) had to be present, in close
   interaction with them. This is so because the latter would have
   provided, precisely, the enabling conditions for the robust, autonomous
   production of the former, as well as the phenotypic context within
   which those emergent biopolymers could carry out and unfold their
   diverse functional roles, including template replication.

   The problem is intricate, though: approaches that have suggested
   self-sustaining autocatalytic networks as an alternative basis for the
   origins of life (i.e. metabolism-first scenarios [51–56]) also face
   their own set of problems. Potentially capable of robust
   self-maintenance, autocatalytic networks have nevertheless obtained
   very little experimental support in prebiotic conditions [57,58], and
   hold severe theoretical limitations as well (e.g. the depletion of
   certain network intermediates when side reactions are considered, or
   the lack of evolvability in the absence of some mechanism of heredity
   [16]).

   In addition, both ‘replication-first’ and ‘metabolism-first’ approaches
   face further trouble, such as the permanent threat of dilution and the
   spatio-temporal coordination of the underlying processes. These
   difficulties seem to force the inclusion of self-assembled compartments
   in the picture, as they incorporate selectively permeable boundaries
   that could keep concentration levels of the relevant chemical species
   above critical thresholds, and would mark a clear ‘inside–outside’
   distinction (i.e. a strong criterion of individuality). At the same
   time, the presence of such compartments (commonly assumed to be
   vesicles with an internal aqueous core, but perhaps initially reducible
   to simpler, two-phase systems—like droplets or Oparin's ‘coacervates’)
   would provide the adequate scale and scaffold for molecules to start
   getting organized functionally and would turn those complex molecular
   systems into lifelike individuals with capacity to evolve as
   protocellular systems (e.g. [59,60]).

   Thus, one can reformulate the question of the origins of life in the
   following global terms: before full-fledged biological systems appeared
   on Earth, what systems could overcome the apparent thermodynamic
   barrier to complexification and produce the rather intricate
   self-reproducing entities that initiated evolution in a Darwinian
   sense? There is no current answer for this riddle; therefore, we need a
   more general conceptual framework to understand chemical evolution. The
   required theory should account for the increase in complexity that
   occurred in prebiotic times, when chemistry was already complex and
   heterogeneous but still far from generating the self-replicating
   polymers, the self-sustaining protometabolic cycles and the
   self-multiplying protocellular compartments whose efficient functional
   integration brought about the first living systems. In the remaining
   sections of this prospective review, a first sketch of what such a new
   conceptual framework might look like is offered, relating it to several
   key advances that have occurred in the field of ‘prebiotic systems
   chemistry’ [28] during the last few years.

3. Chemical evolution through the development of autonomous functional
systems

   Our perspective considers an extension of the Darwinian framework for
   the study of prebiotic chemical evolution, but not in the traditional
   way that this has been carried out within the field of origins (i.e.
   searching for minimal self-replicating molecular systems [61–65]) or,
   more recently, with the inclusion of compartments under a similar
   scheme [60,66–68]. Instead, we suggest to apply an evolutionary account
   in the context of autonomous systems that are made of diverse
   combinations of chemical precursors (i.e. (bio)molecules and their
   supramolecular assemblies). The underlying hypothesis is that, under
   adequate physico-chemical conditions, those molecular species and
   assemblies will achieve a collective reinforcement through various
   types of interaction (e.g. mutual chemical transformations, recognition
   and control relationships, self-assembly, pattern formation, collective
   synchronization phenomena and physical boundary effects). Consequently,
   some of these mixed bio-precursors, together with the processes that
   they trigger off in interaction, will increase their dynamic/structural
   stability by becoming functionally engaged with each other. This should
   enable researchers to design experiments of competition and selection
   among different types of such individuals, in order to test their
   actual dynamic robustness and evolutionary potential.

   Central to our account is the idea of function, a key concept in
   biology that is projectable to a chemical scenario. By function we
   understand any distinct contribution, by a distinguishable part of a
   system, to the maintenance of that system as a whole [69,70]. In other
   words, we take a dispositional (organizational) standpoint with regard
   to this concept, which highlights its relational character. A part of
   the system (e.g. a molecule), by itself, does not have a function. It
   can only have it in connection to other components of such a system,
   that is, in the context of an organization. In general, an organization
   can belong to the natural world or be human-made (e.g. an artificial
   device or machine). The main difference between them consists in
   whether the function is defined externally (i.e. by the person building
   the machine, with all its parts) or has an endogenous source and goal.
   We are interested in spontaneously formed, autonomous systems, like
   living organisms, so the focus here will be on the latter.

   A preliminary reflection, from the definition just given, is that it
   will be hard—if not impossible—to find natural systems with only one or
   two functions. Accordingly, one of the key issues to address is
   determining the minimal number and type of chemical
   components/interactions required to obtain a system in which
   relationships can start being properly considered as functional. In
   other words, a central motivation behind our proposal consists in
   naturalizing an organizational conception of function, endowed with
   biological (i.e. physiological) meaning, but well-grounded in
   evolutionary systems chemistry.

   This perspective may hold some similarities with other theoretical
   schemes recently developed with the aim to explain the evolution of
   complex systems. Pascal et al. [14], for example, argue about a
   sequence of stages in which chemical systems of increasing stability or
   robustness appear, thus opening the possibility for new developments
   within the time window allowed by their relative stability. In addition
   to some thermodynamic considerations of interest (e.g. ‘the cost of
   irreversibility’), these authors focus on the idea that stability could
   be provided by reaction kinetics, whenever there are autocatalytic or
   replication processes involved (i.e. what they refer to as ‘dynamic
   kinetic control’ [13–15]). This is indeed a relevant contribution to
   the field, coherent with the state-of-the-art experimental research,
   yet we feel that the problem, right from the beginning, presents more
   variables than just molecular kinetics (see below).

   Another recent contribution that could hold some resemblance with ours
   is the ‘synergism hypothesis’ [71], since it defends that cooperative
   phenomena of various kinds may synchronize and produce novel, combined
   functional advantages, as a result of which ‘synergistic wholes’ would
   become the actual units of evolutionary change. However, even if this
   account of ‘function’ highlights it as a relational concept, as we do,
   the theoretical framework where it is embedded is very different,
   centred on the evolution of biological complexity. Corning and
   Szathmary develop their ideas from an evolutionary theory background,
   discarding the paradigms of ‘self-organization’ and classical
   ‘complexity sciences’ as significant contributions to the problem. In
   contrast, we propose a full integration between the two traditions.
   With that aim, a first approximation to a theory of autonomous
   functional systems is put forward in the next section, including
   ingredients from evolutionary biology and also from physics and
   chemistry, so that a better understanding about basic/minimal
   biological organization can be reached (i.e. about the actual units of
   life, not just about abstract ‘units of evolution’).

4. Outline of a theory of autonomous functional systems

   It is out of the scope of this short critical review to give a full
   account of the emergence of autonomous (bio)chemical functions. In
   fact, the empirical results and theoretical insights delivered so far
   by the field of systems chemistry are not yet fully ripe to tackle such
   a task. Nevertheless, we would like to put on the table a concrete
   hypothesis, with the aim to illustrate the global idea that the problem
   involves several irreducible dimensions and, therefore, must be given a
   multidimensional solution. This is depicted in figure 2, which shows
   four different though interdependent types of control mechanisms that,
   according to our view, are fundamental requirements to assemble
   autonomous functional systems with evolutionary potential to become
   biological.

   Figure 2.

   Schematic of the minimal set of control mechanisms that should operate,
   in a highly interdependent manner, to support the development of the
   first autonomous functional systems in the context of heterogeneous
   prebiotic chemistries. These mechanisms involve: (i) kinetic control,
   to coordinate the different reaction processes in time and enable
   transformations that reinforce the incipient chemistry but would
   otherwise be kinetically hindered; (ii) spatial control, to establish a
   clear inside/outside distinction and preserve minimal concentration
   thresholds of the relevant chemical species; (iii) energetic control,
   to facilitate the thermodynamically uphill but necessary reactions; and
   (iv) variability control, for these systems to have a minimal chance to
   evolve, through NS, into more complex forms. These four types of
   control mechanisms are represented as the vertices of a tetrahedron
   (with candidate molecular and supramolecular components suggested in
   red) and connected to each other by integrative and cooperative
   chemical couplings (black edges). Individuals with such an irreducible
   heterogeneity in their composition (and complexity in their dynamic
   behaviour) would constitute proper candidates as units of selection in
   this extended framework to conceive prebiotic chemical evolution. As a
   result of that evolutionary process, one could envision further
   functional diversification and more efficient integration (through new
   coupling processes), which would confer higher dynamic robustness to
   increasingly complex individuals in the population (a stage that is
   schematically illustrated by the multiple tetrahedron within the
   initial, elementary one).

   The implementation of those mechanisms could be achieved by different
   molecular components, but our thesis is that all of them: (i) must be
   produced from a common web of interlinked reaction and transformation
   processes; and (ii) must play a role in the maintenance of such a web,
   that is, they become intrinsically functional, as distinguishable parts
   of a system with differentiated contributions to its maintenance.
   Technically speaking, they are constraints on the dynamic behaviour of
   other material components of the system, and they exert mutual
   reinforcing influences on each other (i.e. they constitute functionally
   coupled constraints). The autonomy of the system therefore comes from
   its capacity to synthesize those components that, precisely, turn
   functional [72,73]. In other words, not all components of the system
   need to be internally synthesized (i.e. many will actually be taken up
   from the environment) but those that become functional should derive
   from—or be directly involved in— the incipient, protometabolic reaction
   network.

   This is why it is so important, in the design and implementation of
   experiments, to work with molecular precursors rather than with final
   functional products—such as biopolymers or their aggregates. And this
   is why the problem of origins of life is, ultimately, a chemical
   problem. Nevertheless, we have no chance to find the relevant chemistry
   towards life unless we think about it from biology: from our knowledge
   of current living beings and, in particular, of the core functions
   performed by universal biochemical mechanisms. This takes us back to
   figure 2, and to the explanation of why we have chosen a tetrahedron as
   the geometry that best captures our proposal, which assumes that those
   functions (control mechanisms) can be implemented chemically, as is
   briefly described in the next paragraphs.

4.1. Kinetic control

   This is the most evident control mechanism to be introduced, already
   considered pivotal by a majority of researchers. In fact, most
   origins-of-life experts conceive the problem as a transition from
   thermodynamic to kinetic control, eventually championed by genetically
   encoded enzymes [74,75]. So, the main difficulty around this vertex of
   the tetrahedron is not highlighting its importance, but finding what
   type of components could have carried out catalytic tasks before the
   advent of stereospecific protein enzymes. The field of organocatalysis
   should provide many potential candidates, but the methods applied in
   this area of research are typically looking for the optimization of
   single synthetic processes, mostly for the chemical industry, and they
   lack a prebiotic, systems view in their approach. Oligopeptides
   constitute the most parsimonious option, without excluding
   oligonucleotides that could have also played catalytic roles, like
   ribozymes do in current biochemistry. However, a lot has to be explored
   in this direction, including the contribution of mineral surfaces or
   multi-layers, metal ions or other types of low-molecular-weight
   compounds that could work as co-factors. Also, the presence of soft
   supramolecular structures (e.g. fatty acid- or lipid-made vesicles) may
   have an effect on the yield and the kinetics of processes that are not
   so favourable in bulk aqueous solution [76,77]. This brings us to the
   right-hand vertex of the tetrahedron depicted in figure 2.

4.2. Spatial control

   Together with the temporal coordination of reaction processes, it is
   fundamental to develop mechanisms that harness the movement and spatial
   distribution of the various molecules that constitute the system. This
   is required not only to avoid dilution effects in free solution, which
   are always a threat to its cohesiveness, but also to enrich chemical
   behaviour itself—like Turing demonstrated long ago [78] and other
   authors have also highlighted as a key for the problem of life origins
   [79,80]. Indeed, the concentrations and spatial organization of the
   molecular components of all living beings (and, thereby, their
   metabolic activity, robustness and viability under changes in the
   external conditions) depend critically on their cellular nature.
   Furthermore, the actual identity and individuality of living systems is
   defined through the synthesis of their own boundaries and the
   mechanisms of interaction with their environment, which are usually
   anchored to the cell membrane [72]. Extensive experimental work during
   the last decades suggests that, at a very primitive stage of prebiotic
   chemical evolution, these boundaries were probably lipidic in nature,
   yet involving much simpler molecular structures and compositions than
   current ones [81–83].

4.3. Energetic control

   In addition to kinetic and spatial control mechanisms, energy
   transduction is also at the heart of the problem, precisely because
   some of the necessary synthetic processes tend to be endergonic, and
   thus need to be coupled to exergonic ones. In a prebiotic context,
   these thermodynamic hurdles could be overcome through the activation of
   substrates with coupling reagents (e.g. cyanamide, carbodiimides and
   carbonyldiimidazole) [84–87] or making use of electrochemical gradients
   established across lipidic membranes [88]. In addition, pyrophosphate
   may have played the role of a primitive energy currency, while
   aminoacyl adenylates would represent an activated form of amino acids
   with a potential evolutionary connection with central molecules of the
   current translational machinery [89,90].

   Thus, kinetic, spatial and energetic control mechanisms must interweave
   to bring about chemistries that support the minimum levels of
   complexity required for a system to become functionally autonomous
   [72]. In this context, cooperative events that make a new catalyst
   and/or a new energetic currency accessible, facilitating the synthesis
   of other components of the network, can be promoted (even if they imply
   a transition to higher levels of chemical complexity) if they confer a
   selectable advantage to the system as a whole, increasing its overall
   robustness. At some point, though, a ‘trade-off’ between complexity and
   stability will show up: the higher the complexity of the functional
   components and their relationships, the more difficult it becomes
   retaining them, without changes, in the system. After all,
   self-maintenance is based on far-from-equilibrium reaction cycles in
   which there is a continuous turnover of the molecular species involved.
   This reveals an unavoidable evolutionary bottleneck in any realistic
   prebiotic scenario, and this is why the fourth vertex of the
   tetrahedron, related to the capacity of controlling variability, must
   be included.

4.4. Variability control

   It seems reasonable to assume that, at first, there would be little
   control on variation in these compartmentalized chemical mixtures. But,
   as we said above, the efficacy of NS depends on the appearance of
   mechanisms through which an accurate transmission of key features of
   these systems to their ‘progeny’ should be guaranteed—or, at least,
   turn statistically significant. Further research, including
   experimental work, must be carried out in order to determine how
   prominent variability control turns out to be during the initial stages
   of the evolutionary process, when system reproduction is probably a
   rather stochastic event [66,91,92]. Yet, there is no doubt that it must
   come into play, along with the implementation of mechanisms of heredity
   showing increasing reliability, for these prebiotic systems to overcome
   the abovementioned complexity–stability bottleneck.

   In relation to this point, the capacity for cyclic and stationary
   reproduction regimes could well come about only as a result of
   subsequent stages in which a stronger degree of functional integration
   is achieved (see the mid-upper part of figure 1, roughly corresponding
   to the inner polyhedron in figure 2). Nevertheless, those stages could
   not develop out of the blue: the previous co-localization and
   coordination of supramolecular assemblies (e.g. vesicles and
   coacervates), catalysts (e.g. small-molecule organocatalysts, peptides
   or short oligonucleotides) and some energy currencies (e.g.
   electrochemical gradients and coupling agents, like pyrophosphate or
   some other ATP precursor) would be required [29]. The emergence of
   complex chemistries that resemble biochemistries (represented in the
   upper layers of figure 1) therefore implies, according to our view, the
   previous synthesis of a relatively wide variety of relatively simple
   molecular species and supramolecular assemblies (in the lower layers of
   figure 1), which have immediate effects on those actual synthetic
   processes, reinforcing their couplings and overall dynamic stability.

5. Implications for the origins of life

   The most important—and most difficult—aspect of the problem, as it has
   been approached here, is to determine specific sets of processes and
   chemical couplings that could support the coordination of the primary
   functions required to put together and maintain prebiotic autonomous
   systems. According to what we just emphasized at the end of the
   previous section, the minimal functional systems that we are focusing
   on should be generally considered as protocells, as they involve
   heterogeneous assemblies of molecules in compartments whose dynamic
   behaviour is intrinsically linked with chemical reactions and various
   other processes [93].

   Chemistry, fortunately, offers multiple options for the emergence and
   development of those composite protocellular individuals: (i) direct
   reaction couplings (i.e. transformation processes that share one or
   more chemical species); (ii) negative and positive feedback loops
   (autocatalytic cycles); (iii) stoichiometric couplings between several
   autocatalytic cycles, a la Ganti [94,95]; (iv) physical restrictions on
   molecular movement (by means of diverse kinds of boundaries); (v)
   osmotic couplings, if the chemical system is encapsulated within a
   volume-changing compartment (like a lipid vesicle) [96]; (vi)
   self-assembly processes (sustaining supramolecular structures); (vii)
   oligomerization reactions; (viii) endergonic–exergonic couplings (like
   (i), but with an energy currency involved); (ix) catalyst-mediated
   couplings (like in reflexive autocatalytic sets, a la Kauffman)
   [53,55]; and (x) regulatory couplings (second-order control mechanisms,
   in response to internal/external perturbations) [97].

   These options are not mutually exclusive: they could operate in
   parallel, or intermingled. Several components from the vertices of the
   tetrahedron in figure 2, or combinations thereby (e.g. a peptide
   inserted into a lipid membrane), could actually be involved in
   different kinds of those couplings. The main point here is that a
   relatively simple (pre-biopolymer) chemical scenario already comprises
   plenty of diversity, both in terms of material components and processes
   of transformation. In fact, the degree of diversity is such that it is
   bound to trigger a combinatorial explosion of variables and parameters,
   difficult to handle. The new methodologies that systems chemists are
   developing to analyse complex molecular mixtures and heterogeneous
   assemblies will be helpful in this regard [28,98,99]. However, the
   problem of combinatorial explosion will not be tamed unless we
   integrate knowledge from synthetic biology and the top-down approaches
   toward achieving minimal cells in the laboratory [100,101], in order to
   restrict chemical options and to design experiments involving the
   proper suite of molecular precursors under prebiotically relevant
   conditions.

   Furthermore, the required experimental work should be done not only
   under constant environmental conditions, but also in competitive
   scenarios, i.e. in interaction with other protocellular systems with
   similar energetic and material requirements [66,68,92]. If resources
   (i.e. substrates or energy supplies) are kept limited, this competition
   will eventually lead to selective dynamics in which certain
   combinations of functions (e.g. those who prove to be more efficient,
   more robust, etc.) will remain in the population. Therefore, a
   correlation between functional properties, coupling and integrative
   mechanisms, NS and evolutionary dynamics should be drawn.

   In this respect, our intuition is that during a first period of
   prebiotic chemical evolution, fitness would be simply associated with
   the dynamic stability of protocellular systems, taken as individual
   units. Then, as a result of the collective dynamics and interactions
   that are bound to occur in this context (not only competitive, but also
   including collaborative or ‘symbiotic’ interactions), individuals with
   a more complex and functionally integrated organization would possibly
   come about (again, represented by the inner polyhedron in figure 2).
   The new properties of these selected individuals (e.g. more reliable
   reproduction, higher control of variability and more efficient
   catalysis), would, in turn, allow for new evolutionary dynamics, with a
   stronger operational power of NS. This would get progressively closer
   to an open-ended evolution type of process, like the one we observe in
   the current biosphere (corresponding to the upper layer of figure 1).
   The key evolutionary transitions that could have occurred in the
   proposed scenario, together with the corresponding molecular entities
   involved, are depicted in figure 3. The later stages of prebiotic
   evolution (sketched on the right-hand side of figure 3) are also
   relevant, but lie outside the scope of the present contribution.

   Scheme showing the main evolutionary transitions proposed for prebiotic
   chemistry and the overall process of origins of life. The notion of
   protocell populations employed here is remarkably wide, understood as
   heterogeneous, compartmented and functionally integrated assemblies of
   molecules that could implement, in successive stages, the different
   processes, capacities and mechanisms shown at the lower part of the
   figure.

6. Conclusion

   In this prospective critical review, we have focused on the first steps
   of the process of the origins of life, which have important
   implications for subsequent stages. Ours constitute a non-conventional
   approach to prebiotic evolution, because it shifts the attention from
   homogeneous populations of molecules to populations of heterogeneous,
   compartmentalized and functionally integrated assemblies of molecules.
   The consequences of such a shift of perspective are multiple, both at
   the level of the individual units—which require an adequate
   characterization as self-maintaining systems with an internal
   organization—and also in terms of their collective and long-term
   evolutionary dynamics, based on competition, collaboration and
   selection mechanisms that are in need of further investigation.

   The fact that such compartmentalized individuals possess an internal
   organization allows speaking about function in a physiologically
   relevant sense, because one can distinguish between parts of the system
   that contribute in a distinctive way to its maintenance as a whole.
   Immediate research goals to be targeted, in this context, will be: (i)
   the implementation of feasible versions of these composite systems,
   under specific experimental conditions; and (ii) the careful analysis
   and characterization of the roles played by the various kinds of
   molecules involved in the integrative process, ascribing functional
   properties to each of them. In this way, the concept of function has
   good chances to get naturalized, opening a scientific research
   programme to discover its deep chemical roots. As a result, new
   perspectives and theoretical approaches to understand evolvability as a
   general property of matter, well-grounded in experimental data, should
   also be brought forth.
