Evolution in reverse is nothing surprising

   Published 28 July 2021

   From Ben Haller, Ithaca, New York, US

   You report research suggesting that after land-dwelling tetrapods
   evolved from fish, some tetrapod species “surprisingly” evolved to live
   in the water again (19 June, p 21).

   But is this surprising? We know that cetaceans made the same
   transition, even after becoming far more adapted to life on land than
   early tetrapods. More broadly, we know many flightless bird species had
   a flying ancestor, many aquatic insects descended from insects that
   evolved on land and many parasites have lost limbs or eyes, say, that
   are no longer needed.

   The idea that evolution is unidirectional is a fallacy, as Stephen Jay
   Gould wrote. The reality is that where there is a niche, evolution
   often finds ways to fill it, regardless of the direction of previous
   evolution.
