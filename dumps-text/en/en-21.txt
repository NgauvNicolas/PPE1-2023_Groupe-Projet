   Evolution 9 Collection

A new design for a new era

   Just as Calibers 9SA5 and 9RA2 make significant and defining statements
   about the future of Grand Seiko’s technical development, this
   collection charts a new course for its design. It speaks to the next
   generation with its confident lines, powerful presence and quiet
   radiance but also draws on its deep roots in the traditions and culture
   of Japan.
   Its heritage and pedigree are immediately clear. It is true in every
   way to the principles of the Grand Seiko Style that were defined in
   1967 with the celebrated 44GS but translates them anew for the decades
   to come. Grand Seiko’s hallmark attributes of precision, legibility and
   beauty are plain to see in every detail but there is a new power and
   depth in both the shape of the case and the look of the dial. This
   collection design exudes strength and has a powerful presence yet
   remains understated and restrained.
