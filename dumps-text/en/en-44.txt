Abstract

   Evolution is both a fact and a theory. Evolution is widely observable
   in laboratory and natural populations as they change over time. The
   fact that we need annual flu vaccines is one example of observable
   evolution. At the same time, evolutionary theory explains more than
   observations, as the succession on the fossil record. Hence, evolution
   is also the scientific theory that embodies biology, including all
   organisms and their characteristics. In this paper, we emphasize why
   evolution is the most important theory in biology. Evolution explains
   every biological detail, similar to how history explains many aspects
   of a current political situation. Only evolution explains the patterns
   observed in the fossil record. Examples include the succession in the
   fossil record; we cannot find the easily fossilized mammals before 300
   million years ago; after the extinction of the dinosaurs, the fossil
   record indicates that mammals and birds radiated throughout the planet.
   Additionally, the fact that we are able to construct fairly consistent
   phylogenetic trees using distinct genetic markers in the genome is only
   explained by evolutionary theory. Finally, we show that the processes
   that drive evolution, both on short and long time scales, are
   observable facts.

   In recent years, the teaching of creationism within science curricula
   has become a subject of public debate worldwide (Miller et al., 2006;
   Reiss 2011). Most of the attention has been given to cases in the
   United States of America (Jackson et al., 1995; Berkman and Plutzer,
   2011; Baltzley, 2016; Ross, 2017), where many bills have been submitted
   to the Houses of Representatives encouraging teachers to express their
   criticism about evolution. In more serious cases, such as Turkey,
   evolution has recently been removed from the high school curriculum
   (Kingsley, 2017), and in Brazil, intelligent design research has
   recently reached university level (Silva, 2017). The rise of
   “anti-vaxxers” and “flat-earthers” openly demonstrates that the
   anti-science movement is not confined to biology, with devastating
   consequences such as the vaccine-preventable outbreaks (Miller et al.,
   2015). At the same time, the anti-science debates have been usually
   promoted by anti-scientists and have stayed marginal to scientific
   literature. This explains the rising trend and confirms the need for
   scientists to hastily step into the scene. With this in mind, we felt
   compelled to address basic aspects of science and of the scientific
   method in the evolution versus divine creation debate in a scientific
   journal.

   Science can be defined as being both the criterion for gathering
   scientific data (scientific method), as well as the explanatory
   theories that were developed following its criteria (scientific
   knowledge) (Project 2061 American Association for the Advancement of
   Science, 1993; Roberts 2007). A few centuries ago, scientists decided
   to select a small part of human knowledge to restrict the method used
   to assemble this knowledge. The use of the scientific method does not
   mean that this is more valuable than other types of knowledge; it is
   just more reliable in uncovering natural laws (Atkins, 1995).

   One should regard science as a process in which scientists formulate
   hypotheses to explain certain facts and to test their predictive models
   by confronting their predictions with new facts (Gilbert, 1991). A fact
   is something that we observe. For instance, when we drop an object, it
   falls to the ground. This is a fact. The scientific theory that
   explains why objects fall is the theory of gravity. A valid scientific
   theory can never become a fact (Gould, 1981), as there is always the
   possibility that a future explanation will better match newly
   discovered facts.

Evolution as a fact and theory

   Evolution is a population concept. An individual does not evolve; only
   populations evolve in the face of the genetic changes accumulated from
   one generation to the next. The flu virus evolves. This explains why
   last years’ flu vaccine does not work on the current strain of the
   virus: only the resistant strains of the virus survived last year’s
   vaccine application. This is a textbook example of evolution by natural
   selection. Genetic modifications are encountered in the resistant
   strains; thus, evolution is a fact (Gould, 1981). Mutation, migration,
   natural selection, and genetic drift are the evolutionary forces that
   drive genetic changes of natural populations from one generation to the
   next. This is known among biologists as microevolution.

   On the other hand, evolutionary theory explains more than those facts
   that we can routinely observe. This makes it a theory, but is it just a
   theory? The word theory has distinct meanings in science and in lay
   language (Ghose, 2013). A scientific theory is the utmost position an
   idea may reach in science. Outside of academia, however, a theory is
   equivalent to a hypothesis, an idea that explains facts but has never
   been tested (Futuyama and Kirkpatrick, 2017). This occurs because there
   seems to be no need for a distinction between hypothesis and theory
   outside the scope of science. In science, however, this distinction is
   fundamental. An idea remains a hypothesis if it has never been
   confronted with new (independently collected) scientific data that
   would serve as a test for its predictions. If a hypothesis has endured
   further testing by subsequent scientific experiments, in time it
   becomes a valid scientific theory (Figure 1).

   Figure 1
   The flow chart illustrates the difference between a scientific
   hypothesis and a scientific theory. A theory is the highest place an
   explanation for facts may reach in science.

   For any given valid scientific theory there are three possibilities.
   The first possibility is that the true explanation for the facts is
   entirely different from the valid scientific theory. In this case, all
   scientific experiments aimed to test the theory were flawed in design
   or in the interpretation of the results. The second possibility is that
   the true explanation for the facts is more restricted than the current
   scientific theory claims. In this case, the predictions of the theory
   agreed with newly collected data because all tests focused on a single
   (and true) aspect of the theory. Finally, the last alternative is that
   the true explanation for the facts is the scientific theory. Science
   has the tools to reject (first alternative) and to refine (second
   alternative) scientific theories when they are confronted with new
   data. However, even theories that endure many tests must still face
   these three possibilities, as, even in light of the true explanation,
   science does not furnish us the tools to perceive truthfulness.

   A hallmark of natural sciences is that scientific hypotheses and
   scientific theories must make predictions about the natural world
   (Paz-y-Miño and Spinosa, 2011). Often, the older the theory, the more
   reliable it is because it has survived many empirical tests.
   Furthermore, the more universal the theory, the more robust it becomes
   with time, as more tests would have been performed. According to
   Darwin, evolutionary theory is centred around two points (Darwin,
   1859). First, from one generation to the next, natural populations
   change over time by a process of natural selection. Second, all
   organisms have a common ancestor, and the time since this last common
   ancestor lived is inversely proportional to the similarities that the
   organisms will share today. Hence, evolutionary theory is universal
   because it includes all (living and fossil) biological diversity and
   has implications for all heritable characteristics of life. Since 1859,
   evolutionary theory has become the most universal and, hence, widely
   tested of the scientific theories in biology.

   Today, Darwin’s original theory has been refined, as he himself
   anticipated that it would be (Darwin, 1871). This occurred in many
   fronts because recent concepts, such as genetic drift and mutations,
   have provided more details on how natural populations evolve. One
   example is the understanding that, at the molecular level, random
   evolution, rather than natural selection, plays the most important role
   (Kimura, 1991). This is known as the neutral theory, which completed
   its 50^th anniversary in 2018.

   The substance of Darwin’s original theory, however, remains. Theodosius
   Dobzhansky (1973) shared his astonishment that Charles Darwin proposed
   the theory of evolution without many key biological concepts, such as
   that DNA is the molecule responsible for heredity. Half a century after
   Dobzhansky’s paper, it remains impressive that the theory of evolution
   still stands valid in light of the discoveries of the molecular biology
   revolution. Each newly sequenced genome tests some aspects of Darwin’s
   theory, and, on each case, the sequence has been consistent with
   Darwin’s prediction of the shared evolutionary history of life. The
   sharp increase in scope and universality of evolution has strengthened
   Darwin’s original proposal and made evolutionary theory one of the most
   reliable and tested theories in the natural sciences (National Academy
   of Sciences, 2008).

   Some creationists dispute this information, claiming that scientists
   discredit data that go against evolutionary theory. Nonetheless, there
   is no room for considering worldwide, long-lasting conspiracies in
   science, as scientific fame and recognition come from the demolition of
   old theories, not from adherence to them (Atkins, 1995). Indeed,
   scientists themselves have challenged many aspects of the original
   Darwinian theory of evolution, such as the importance of neutral
   evolution, the discovery of epigenetics, the proposal of punctuated
   equilibrium, etc. When these challenges were first proposed, they were
   not ignored; they were published in top scientific journals and have
   been subject to meticulous research and have generated fruitful debates
   in the scientific arena.

   Furthermore, if scientists were dishonestly accepting a false theory of
   evolution, Lamarck’s theory of inheritance of acquired characters would
   still be considered valid today. However, it is not. In the XIX
   century, August Weissman (1889) removed the tails of 20 generations of
   mice, but no significant decrease in length was found in the
   descendants’ tails. Scientists themselves devised the scientific
   experiment that bluntly rejected Lamarck’s proposal as a mechanism of
   evolution (Dobzhansky, 1973). Scientists do not discredit data that
   goes against evolution; otherwise, Lamarck’s idea would still be
   accepted. They discredit scientific untestable theories and
   explanations that were not gathered using the scientific method.

The cornerstone of biology

   Just as human history explains the geopolitical configurations of our
   world today, modern biological systems are a direct result of their
   evolutionary past. Hence, evolutionary theory is the cornerstone of the
   discipline of biology (Rutledge and Warden, 2000). The discipline of
   biology today is an instantaneous portrayal of the dynamic evolutionary
   axis that arose with the origin of life and has been changing by
   evolution ever since (Figure 2). With the first life, genetics,
   ecology, biochemistry and evolution began.

   Figure 2
   The relationship between evolution and biology. Ever since the origin
   of life, evolutionary processes, such as mutation, selection, and
   genetic drift, are responsible for genetic change in natural and
   laboratory populations. Hence, biology is an instantaneous snap-shot of
   the dynamic evolutionary axis. This simplified figure illustrates some,
   of the many, faunal explosions that have took place since the origin of
   life.

   As a scientific theory, however, which facts does evolutionary theory
   explain? One pivotal example is the succession in the fossil record.
   This evolution, namely, macroevolution, explains the larger
   evolutionary picture that is the appearance of the greater groups, such
   as the evolution of mammals, insects, and plants. Fossilized mammals
   are easily recognized, as they have distinct types of teeth, such as
   molars, canines, and incisors. These vertebrates are also very likely
   to fossilize on account of their rigid teeth and hard cranium. If
   mammals are so easily fossilized, how can we explain a rich fossil
   record full of vertebrates and invertebrates with no mammalian fossil
   before 300 million years ago?

   Similarly, if we dig deeper still, disclosing 500 million years old
   layers, we find no hard skeleton vertebrates but plenty of fossilized
   invertebrates in a boost of diversity that we call the Cambrian
   Explosion. There are no vertebrates in this explosion because
   vertebrates appear in a much later explosion. Digging even deeper, to
   600 million years old records, we find strata with soft-bodied
   Ediacaran animals but no hard-shelled invertebrates and no vertebrates.
   In one billion years old strata, we find only single-celled organisms.

   How can we find, in old strata, many single celled organisms but not a
   single mammalian tooth? The only reasonable explanation for these facts
   is that 400 million years ago, mammals had not yet evolved; 500 million
   years ago, vertebrates had not yet evolved; 600 million years ago,
   hard-shelled invertebrates had not yet evolved; and one billion years
   ago, multicellular life had not yet evolved. Smaller local successions
   are also observable in the fossil record; such as the beautiful strings
   of intermediate fossils that include amphibians (Kustchera and Elliot,
   2013), birds, whales (Thewissen, 2009), horses, and humans. These
   successions in the fossil record are the most obvious evidence to
   macroevolution (Figure 2). In fact, the entire fossil record is a set
   of millions of intermediate fossils that provide solid evidence of how
   macroevolution worked in the past billion years.

Evolutionary processes that drive micro and macroevolution are facts

   To have a better understanding of evolution, we must discuss the
   processes that drive evolution. For this, we start by comparing
   processes that drive microevolution with those that drive
   macroevolution. Many of the same evolutionary processes that drive
   microevolution also drive macroevolution, namely natural selection,
   mutation, migration, and genetic drift. A lineage will tend to
   diversify if it has adaptations that increase survival and reproductive
   abilities compared to other species. This advantage will tend to
   increase population size and the geographical distribution of the
   ancestral species that will more likely speciate into two descendant
   species. Hence, according to this view, macroevolution is
   microevolution on a larger scale (Zimmer, 2001), with biological
   speciation as the only additional process (Russo et al., 2016). Through
   speciation, one ancestral species gives rise to two descendant species
   that are reproductively incompatible with each other.

   More than a million species have been described (Mora et al., 2011),
   and each biological species includes many interbreeding members. Also,
   most species are reproductively isolated from each other. The fact that
   we observe biological species with interbreeding members and
   reproductive isolation between species is compatible with both separate
   creation and macroevolution. So, which observable pattern would we
   expect if many speciation events generated the vast biological
   diversity from a single common ancestor? In this case, we would expect
   different degrees of similarity between reproductively isolated
   species. This is exactly what we observe. Some species are very
   similar, such as chimpanzees and gorillas, with most features shared
   between them. Other species, on the other hand, are morphologically so
   different that one must look into cytology, physiology, or comparative
   genomics to detect evidence of their common past. One example is a fern
   and a frog. For instance, the cellular respiration is a process shared
   by ferns and frogs and it is an evidence of their common ancestry. Only
   macroevolution explains well the distinct degrees of similarity between
   these four isolated species, as the age of their last common ancestor
   is inversely proportional to the similarity between any two species.

   Furthermore, the existence of hybrids, such as the mule, the liger, the
   coywolf, is also only explained by the hierarchical common ancestry
   theory, not by separate creation. The hybrids are direct evidence of
   on-going processes of speciation. Thus, the presence of hybrids is what
   we would expect if all life had a common ancestry.

   Other fossil record patterns are well explained by macroevolution. For
   instance, why do we find a major increase in mammalian fossil diversity
   only after the disappearance of non-avian dinosaurs approximately 65
   million years ago? The same pattern is observed in the fossil record of
   birds. Macroevolution explains this well, as the extinction of
   dinosaurs eliminated competition, and the surviving ancestral mammals
   were able to increase in number and diversified through speciation,
   generating more species of their kind.

Final remarks

   A single, very well designed experiment, performed in accordance with
   the utmost scientific standards, is what it takes to put any scientific
   theory to rest. Divine creation will never be part of science because
   science is not able to detect supernatural phenomena. Divine phenomena
   explain everything equally; hence, it provides no real explanatory
   (i.e., predictive) power. If we accept “God’s will” as an adequate
   explanation for a natural phenomenon, we eliminate the possibility of
   eventually being able to explain it naturally. Thus, the scientific
   revolution begun when we eliminated the divine as a scientific
   explanation.

   Science, as a process, starts with the acceptance of our ignorance
   about a natural phenomenon and by seeking natural explanations for it.
   Hence, ignorance drives the engine of Science. Even if evolution were,
   hypothetically, rejected, contested by new data, scientists would have
   to study hard to find an alternative natural explanation that was able
   to explain everything that evolution explains today plus the new data
   that contested it.

   Evolution is a fact and a well-supported scientific theory. It has
   endured daily and rigorous testing, and it stands as the unifying
   theory in biology (Rutledge and Warden, 2000). This says nothing about
   whether God created or did not create the world, as science is unable
   to distinguish a divinely guided evolution from a materialistic
   evolution. God may well have created the biological world through
   natural selection, mutation, speciation, extinction, etc. Still,
   evolution and Science would remain unscathed as Science is not
   concerned with why or who, but only with how.

   Some creationists say that we must bring the evolution versus
   creationist debate to the classroom and claim that the opposition to
   the debate is anti-scientific. However, science is not about blind
   criticism (Meyer and El-Hani, 2013). Blind criticism is just as naïve
   as blind acceptance. Scientists must weigh the evidence before
   questioning a theory. The idea that all debates are equally scientific
   is misleading and it explains the sad emergence of flat-earthers and
   anti-vaxxers. A debate on what is the shape of our planet is not only
   pointless, but it is also dangerously harmful to the minds of the young
   students. A fruitful debate in a science class is restricted to those
   issues that lie within the scientific realm (Baltzley, 2016, Branch,
   2016).

   A recent study has suggested that science concepts, more than
   evolutionary basics, are critical to promoting evolution (Dunk et al.,
   2017). One way to reinforce these fundamentals would be the requirement
   of evolution and science fundaments in admission policies for biology
   professionals, particularly teachers (Larkin and Perry-Ryder, 2015; see
   Rutledge and Warden, 2000 for statistics).
