Humans may have influenced evolution of dogs’ eye colour, researchers say

   Dark eyes are more common in domesticated dogs, possibly because we
   consider this trait more friendly

   Human preferences for a friendly face may have steered the evolution of
   canine eye colour, researchers have suggested.

   Ever since canines were domesticated, some time between 15,000 and
   50,000 years ago, humans have selected – whether consciously or not –
   particular traits in their dogs.

   Among them, it appears humans have a penchant for puppy dog eyes.
   Scientists previously found that dogs have evolved particular facial
   muscles that allow them to pull a doleful expression, triggering a
   nurturing response in humans and so giving such dogs an advantage.

   Now research suggests humans may have influenced canine eye colour,
   too. A study by scientists in Japan found that dark eyes are more
   common in domesticated dogs than their wild relatives, and that humans
   perceive dogs with dark eyes as being more friendly.

   “I speculate that lighter irises have some evolutionary advantage for
   wolves, but domestication has lost this selective pressure and darker
   eyes have emerged in some primitive dogs,” said Akitsugu Konno, the
   first author of the research, from Teikyo University of Science.

   The team say dark eyes may subsequently have been favoured by humans,
   possibly unconsciously, during domestication from wolves to dogs.

   However, Konno noted that the later development of particular breeds
   could also have influenced canine eye colour: for example, the blue
   merle coat colour seen in breeds including shelties and border collies
   is associated with blue eyes.

   Writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science, the team describe
   how they compared iris colour in 22 images of grey wolves of various
   coat colours and from different locations, and images of 81 domestic
   dogs, finding that the latter tended to have darker and more reddish
   eyes.

   The researchers then created 12 pairs of images, with one image of each
   pair showing a domestic dog with light eyes and the other showing the
   same dog with dark eyes. A selection of these pairs was shown to 76
   people who were asked to rate the dogs for various personality traits
   and how much they would like to interact with or keep the dog.

   The team found that dogs with dark eyes were rated higher for
   friendliness than light-eyed dogs and deemed more easy-going, sociable
   and dependent, and less aggressive, intelligent and mature. Similar
   results were obtained when the survey was repeated with another 66
   participants.

   “We speculate that a darker iris makes it more difficult to distinguish
   the size of the pupil and thus gives the illusion of a large pupil,
   which is associated with our perception of being more infant-like,”
   Konno said.

   The researchers add that the association of dark eyes with immaturity
   could influence humans to protect and care for such canines, although
   the study found eye colour was not itself directly related to whether
   participants wanted to interact with or keep the dog.

   “Overall, dogs with dark eyes may have evolved the trait largely as
   means to send non-threatening gaze signal to humans,” the team write.
