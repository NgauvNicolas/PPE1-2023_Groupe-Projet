Why don’t we have eyes in the back of our heads?

   Why hasn’t evolution given us eyes in the back of our head or rear-view
   mirrors?

   John Woodgate, Rayleigh, Essex, UK

   There are at least two reasons. Eyes are biologically expensive things
   to make and rear-view eyes don’t fit well into the very primitive body
   plan that mammals inherited. Even mammals for whom rear vision is a
   prime survival trait, such as rabbits, have only side-facing eyes, with
   sight to the rear being peripheral, but sufficient to provide an alert.

   Humans, and probably some other mammals, do have another adapted sense
   to compensate. In the 1960s, the world of audio was introduced to
   “dummy-head recordings”, using two microphones placed where the ears
   would be in a dummy head to capture sound. This creates a 3D stereo
   experience for listeners using headphones. One particular demonstration
   recording finished with a whisper close to the back of the head, which
   caused the listener to react as if to a severe threat.

   More nuanced experiments showed that sounds behind the head were
   noticed by a listener more than sounds to the front, especially if a
   listener was in a dark room. So our ears can compensate for the lack of
   rear-facing vision.

   You can look at it another way. Rear vision is useful only if potential
   threats are visible. During human evolution, that was most often not
   the case.

   It is also notable that spiders, which tend to have many eyes, only
   have them facing forwards.

   Jonathan Wallace, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK

   There are various aspects to this question. First, it supposes
   evolution works towards particular goals in a planned way, but that
   isn’t the case.

   Genetic mutations arise randomly and are then subject to selection
   pressures that can allow them to become more widespread within the gene
   pool if they are beneficial or eliminate them if they aren’t.

   So one answer is that if a mutation leading to a particular trait, such
   as rear-facing eyes, doesn’t happen in the first place, the trait won’t
   evolve, however advantageous it might seem.

   A second factor is that most traits, especially complex ones such as
   vision, don’t spring fully formed into a gene pool, but develop over
   generations from pre-existing traits and structures.

   In the case of vertebrate limbs, for example, we can see how an
   extraordinary variety of forms and functions have developed from the
   same basic structure.

   What we don’t see, though, is vertebrates evolving extra pairs of limbs
   such that they can have wings and arms for example. It would seem that
   it is relatively easy for an existing structure to be adapted to new
   uses, but harder to create entirely new structures.

   It may therefore be that the architecture of our central nervous system
   has simply not lent itself to the evolution of an extra pair of eyes in
   the back of our head.

   Having said this, it is evident that having the ability to spot
   potential predators creeping up behind us is likely to be beneficial.
   There are other species that have evolved this ability by moving the
   position of their eyes relative to the rest of their skull.

   Many birds have their eyes positioned towards the side of their skull,
   allowing them a very wide angle of vision and, in the case of some
   birds such as the woodcock, they are positioned so they can actually
   achieve 360-degree vision.

   There is a cost to this, though, in terms of loss of binocular vision.
   Species, such as owls, whose predatory lifestyle requires accurate
   judging of distances tend to have forward-facing eyes.

   This reflects another factor, which is that there may be costs and
   benefits to any given trait, and for it to evolve, the benefits have to
   outweigh the costs on average.

   Finally, there is often more than one potential “solution” to a given
   problem. In many species, including most primates, the answer to
   maintaining 360-degree awareness of surrounding hazards is to rely on
   many eyes.

   Social behaviour is common in the animal kingdom and one reason for
   this is that there is safety in numbers. You might be looking the wrong
   way when a leopard approaches, but if your herdmates raise the alarm
   this is as effective as having eyes in the back of your head.
