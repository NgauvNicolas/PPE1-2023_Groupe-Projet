Abstract

   Continuous records of sediment yield spanning from the late glacial
   through the Holocene to the present day provide an important
   opportunity to investigate landscape evolution over various timescales
   in response to a variety of natural and anthropogenic forcing
   mechanisms. This study investigates variations in sediment yield and
   landscape evolution in the 768 km2 watershed of Ossipee Lake, New
   Hampshire, USA. We pair subbottom sonar observations with analyses of
   lacustrine sediment cores to interpret a 12,000+ yr record of lake
   sedimentation in terms of changes in sediment yield and landscape
   evolution. Our results indicate high rates of sediment redistribution
   following deglaciation at ~14,500 to ~12,000 cal yr BP, followed by a
   period of gradually decreasing sediment yield until ~9000 cal yr BP,
   marking the termination of the most intense period of paraglacial
   landscape adjustment. From 9000 cal yr BP to 1850 CE, sediment yield is
   highly variable and reveals a slightly increasing trend that we
   attribute to a dominant hydroclimatic control on erosion driven by
   increasing effective precipitation in the region throughout the
   Holocene. Despite evidence for a highly dynamic landscape and an
   abundance of unconsolidated glacigenic surface deposits throughout the
   watershed, we interpret a modest erosional impact from anthropogenic
   land use.

INTRODUCTION

   A legacy of Pleistocene glaciations in the northeastern United States
   is a widespread, but variable mantle of sediment covering much of the
   landscape (Hitchcock, Reference Hitchcock1878; Goldthwait et al.,
   Reference Goldthwait, Goldthwait and Goldthwait1951). Following
   deglaciation, the rate at which this material has been redistributed
   has been influenced by paraglacial landscape adjustments, changing
   hydroclimatic conditions, and human activities (e.g., Bierman et al.,
   Reference Bierman, Lini, Zehfuss, Church, Davis, Southon and
   Baldwin1997; Francis and Foster, Reference Francis and Foster2001; Cook
   et al., Reference Cook, Yellen, Woodruff and Miller2015, Reference
   Cook, Snyder, Oswald and Paradis2020). Considering this redistribution
   of sediment in terms of watershed sediment yield has direct
   implications for understanding fundamental processes related to soil
   erosion, contaminant transport, reservoir life span, and the delivery
   of sediment to coastal systems. The postglacial landscape evolution of
   the northeastern United States is relevant to our understanding of
   previously glaciated landscapes throughout the world and is
   particularly germane to understanding how mountain landscapes and their
   associated geologic hazards may evolve under conditions of global
   warming and glacial recession, as is happening currently in many
   locations (Knight and Harrison, Reference Knight and Harrison2018).

   Quantifying sediment yield and its response to various forcings is
   especially challenging, given the need for measurements spanning a wide
   range of hydroclimatic conditions (e.g., Croke and Hairsine, Reference
   Croke and Hairsine2006) and the difficulty in deciphering the impacts
   of simultaneous changes in climate and human activity in the recent
   past (e.g., Huggel et al., Reference Huggel, Clague and Korup2012;
   Kasprak et al., Reference Kasprak, Magilligan, Nislow, Renshaw, Snyder
   and Dade2013; Cook et al., Reference Cook, Yellen, Woodruff and
   Miller2015). While geologic archives can capture a wide range of
   climatic conditions under circumstances minimally impacted by humans,
   many of the available archives provide only snapshots of past
   conditions. Sedimentary records from suitably located lakes and ponds
   offer the potential for long, continuous records of sediment
   accumulation, from which estimates of terrestrial sediment yield may be
   derived (e.g., Davis and Ford, Reference Davis and Ford1982; Cook et
   al., Reference Cook, Snyder, Oswald and Paradis2020). A limited number
   of studies in the northeastern United States have examined sediment
   delivery to lakes in response to terrestrial processes; however, the
   majority of existing records have focused on lakes with very small
   (mostly <15 km^2) watersheds, lacked age control over the period most
   heavily impacted by humans, and revealed inconsistent patterns of
   sediment delivery over the Holocene (e.g., Brown et al., Reference
   Brown, Bierman, Lini and Southon2000, Reference Brown, Bierman, Lini,
   Davis and Southon2002; Noren et al., Reference Noren, Bierman, Steig,
   Lini and Southon2002; Parris et al., Reference Parris, Bierman, Noren,
   Prins and Lini2010). Two existing regional records from lakes with
   relatively large watersheds and recent age constraints that allow
   correlation of sedimentary events with historical hydrologic conditions
   and land-use activity span only the past 1100 (Cook et al., Reference
   Cook, Snyder, Oswald and Paradis2020) and 2100 yr (Cook et al.,
   Reference Cook, Yellen, Woodruff and Miller2015), failing to capture
   the period of most intense paraglacial landscape adjustments and the
   largest climatic changes of the Holocene.

   Given the importance of understanding landscape evolution in response
   to changing climate and human activity, and the dearth of suitable
   records, we seek to answer the question: How has the erosion and
   transport of sediment in the northeastern United States varied since
   deglaciation in response to long-term trends in climate, vegetation
   change, past floods, and anthropogenic land use? We do so using
   sediment cores collected from Ossipee Lake, New Hampshire, USA.
   Analysis of these cores is used to reconstruct the mass accumulation
   rate of clastic sediment from ~12,000 cal yr BP to 2017 CE as a proxy
   for watershed sediment yield. Regionally, Ossipee Lake has a uniquely
   large watershed with limited upstream water bodies, a remarkably simple
   lake geometry, and an abundance of unconsolidated sediment mantling its
   watershed. Collectively, these traits distinguish Ossipee Lake as an
   ideal setting for examining the integrated signal of hydroclimatic,
   ecological, and anthropogenic impacts on sediment yield operating
   within a large watershed over various timescales and we evaluate our
   results in relation to regional records of climate and environmental
   change.

STUDY AREA

   Ossipee Lake and its watershed are located in east-central New
   Hampshire, USA (Fig. 1). The 768 km^2 watershed ranges in elevation
   from 124 m at Ossipee Lake, to >1200 m along summits of the Sandwich
   Range of the southeastern White Mountains. Presently, the watershed is
   dominantly forested (78% of current land cover), with only a small
   portion developed (4.5%) or in agricultural use (1%; Dewitz, Reference
   Dewitz2019). Thick surficial deposits surround Ossipee Lake and blanket
   much of the watershed, a legacy of the last glaciation and subsequent
   deglaciation (Newton, Reference Newton1974a, Reference Newton1974b).
   Regional deglaciation occurred around 14,500 cal yr BP (Ridge et al.,
   Reference Ridge, Canwell, Kelly and Kelley2001, Reference Ridge, Balco,
   Bayless, Beck, Carter, Dean, Voytek and Wei2012; Dalton et al.,
   Reference Dalton, Margold, Stokes, Tarasov, Dyke, Adams and Allard2020;
   Ridge, Reference Ridge2022); during the earliest stages of
   deglaciation, much of the low-elevation portions of the Ossipee
   watershed were occupied by a proglacial lake. The size of this lake and
   location of its outlet shifted rapidly in concert with the retreating
   ice front, with the lake surface migrating through a series of steps
   corresponding to present-day elevations of 182 m, 171 m, and 140 m,
   before the current 124 m elevation of the lake was established (Moore
   and Medalie, Reference Moore and Medalie1995). Meltwater from the
   retreating ice front deposited proglacial lake sediments, eskers, kame
   deposits, and outwash plains forming what is today the largest
   stratified drift aquifer within the state of New Hampshire (Moore and
   Medalie, Reference Moore and Medalie1995). Upland areas of the
   watershed are mantled in glacial till (Newton, Reference Newton1974a).

   Postglacial redistribution of surface materials in the Ossipee Lake
   watershed is widely evident, alluding to a dynamic landscape well
   suited to investigations of Holocene landscape evolution. Numerous
   examples of incised stream channels and gullies, alluvial fans, and
   erosional scarps formed from channel and shoreline migration visible in
   light detection and ranging (LIDAR) digital elevation models (DEMs;
   Fig. 2) illustrate the extent of postglacial sediment redistribution
   within the region. The dominantly sandy shoreline of the lake,
   prominent deltas at the mouths of the four primary tributaries entering
   Ossipee Lake (Bearcamp, Lovell, Pine, West Branch; Figs. 1–3), and
   postglacial migration of the lake outlet in response to beach processes
   and long-shore currents (Newton, Reference Newton1974b) further
   illustrate the abundance of available sediment and its ongoing
   redistribution within the watershed.

   (30 cm resolution). Also shown are sediment core locations, subbottom
   sonar track lines, major tributaries to Ossipee Lake, and the prominent
   shallow shelf in the southeastern corner of the lake (modified from
   LeNoir, Reference LeNoir2019). The greatest depth is located at the
   northern coring site.

   Ossipee Lake has a surface area of 13 km^2, average depth of 8.5 m, and
   maximum depth of 19.5 m (Fig. 3). The lake's volume and depth aid in
   trapping sediment from inflowing streams, and its simple bowl-shaped
   geometry likely simplifies transport and depositional patterns within
   the lake. The large catchment area of the Ossipee watershed relative to
   the lake's surface area further helps concentrate the deposition of
   sediment and maximize the signal from terrestrial sediment input.

   Human occupation of the Ossipee watershed likely spans much of the
   Holocene, though regional estimates of the indigenous population in New
   England are relatively low for much of the postglacial period, with
   peaks occurring during the Middle and Late Holocene (Munoz et al.,
   Reference Munoz, Gajewski and Peros2010). Population rose during the
   Late Archaic (6–3 ka) and Late Woodland (1–0.5 ka) intervals. The
   latter peak has been attributed to the regional emergence of
   horticulture of native species and cultigens, especially maize.
   However, archaeological data suggest a minimal role for horticulture
   before the arrival of Europeans (Chilton, Reference Chilton and
   Alt2010). At the time of European arrival to the region in the
   mid-seventeenth century, the main village of the Ossipee tribe was
   located on the western shore of Ossipee Lake, with the lake and its
   tributaries serving as an important travel conduit (Price, Reference
   Price and Piotrowski2002). Euro-American settlement displaced the
   native population and resulted in widespread forest clearance, dam
   construction, and conversion of land to agriculture over the ensuing
   centuries. The town of Ossipee was incorporated in 1785 CE; population
   of the surrounding Carroll County first peaked in 1860 CE, with census
   data recording the presence of 2758 farms and 50% of the surveyed
   county being improved land (Merrill, Reference Merrill1889). The
   Industrial Revolution and western expansion of the United States in the
   late nineteenth century led to the abandonment of many New England
   farms and subsequent natural reforestation. While the present landscape
   remains dominantly forested, rural residential development throughout
   the twentieth and twenty-first centuries has led to increasing
   population, and commercial timber harvest has continued in isolated
   portions of the watershed.

METHODS

   We carried out fieldwork at Ossipee Lake during June 2017 and June
   2018. Subbottom sonar surveys were conducted using a SyQuest StrataBox
   HD single-frequency (10 kHz) instrument. Subbottom depths were
   approximated based on the known water depth and assumption of a
   constant speed of sound. Sediment cores were collected from both the
   northern (43°48.12′N, 71°9.00′W; 19.5 m water depth) and southern
   (43°47.16′N, 71°8.28′W; 17.7 m water depth) ends of the large central
   basin of the lake (Fig. 3). Short (~1 m) gravity cores were collected
   to ensure an intact sediment–water interface; transparent core tubes
   allowed field verification of undisturbed sediment overlain by clear
   water. A single ~2 m piston-percussion core was collected at the
   northern site. Two overlapping sequences of multiple 3 m drives were
   collected from the southern site using a Uwitec piston-percussion
   corer.

   Sediment cores were split lengthwise, visually described, and
   photographed before further analyses were conducted. We used an ITRAX
   (Cox Analytical Systems; Croudace et al., Reference Croudace, Rindby
   and Rothwell2006) core scanner housed in the Geosciences Department at
   the University of Massachusetts Amherst to obtain X-radiographs and
   measure bulk elemental abundances via scanning X-ray fluorescence (XRF)
   using a Mo X-ray source at 30 kV voltage and 55 mA current. Cores were
   scanned at 1.0 mm resolution with a count time of 10 s, except for the
   short surface cores, which were scanned using a 15 s count time. We
   limit our reporting of XRF results to a subset of elements that provide
   insight on terrestrial sediment input. Specifically, we report results
   for potassium, which has been shown to be a reliable indicator of
   clastic sediment input to northeastern lakes (Yellen et al., Reference
   Yellen, Woodruff, Kratz, Mabee, Morrison and Martini2014; Cook et al.,
   Reference Cook, Yellen, Woodruff and Miller2015, Reference Cook,
   Snyder, Oswald and Paradis2020), in addition to silicon and titanium.
   Silicon in lake sediment can be derived from both the input of
   terrestrial sediment and the accumulation of autochthonous silica of
   biogenic origin, with the ratio of silicon to titanium providing
   insight into variations in the relative proportion of biogenic silica
   that comprises the inorganic component of the sediment (Croudace et
   al., Reference Croudace, Rindby and Rothwell2006; Brown, Reference
   Brown, Croudace and Rothwell2015). We note that the 10 s count time
   used for our XRF analyses provides poor detection limits for silicon
   (Brown, Reference Brown, Croudace and Rothwell2015), and thus we are
   limited to qualitative interpretation of these data. Magnetic
   susceptibility was measured using a Bartington MS2E sensor at 0.5 cm
   intervals using split-core logging methodology (Nowaczyk, Reference
   Nowaczyk, Last and Smol2001). Percent loss on ignition (LOI) and dry
   bulk density (ρ[db]) were measured on 1 cm^3 subsamples removed from
   the cores at 1 cm intervals following standard procedures (Dean,
   Reference Dean1974). Continuous composite sedimentary sequences for the
   north and south coring sites were constructed by correlating the visual
   stratigraphy and LOI, magnetic susceptibility, and XRF data from
   individual cores (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, Supplementary Table 1)
   and identifying portions from individual cores that could be spliced
   together into a single continuous sequence. Composite sequences totaled
   2.31 m at the northern site and 8.63 m at the southern site.

   Age constraints for the sedimentary sequence were obtained from a
   combination of ^137Cs and ^210Pb stratigraphy and radiocarbon dating of
   nine terrestrial macrofossils and two bulk sediment samples recovered
   from the cores (Table 1). The clear correlation among cores allowed age
   control points determined from individual cores to be readily placed on
   the composite depth scale (Supplementary Table 1). Radiocarbon dates
   were determined via accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) at the National
   Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry laboratory at Woods Hole
   Oceanographic Institute in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and at Direct AMS
   in Bothell, Washington. Radiocarbon ages were calibrated to calendar
   years BP, where present corresponds to 1950 CE, utilizing the IntCal13
   calibration curve (Reimer et al., Reference Reimer, Bard, Bayliss,
   Beck, Blackwell, Ramsey and Buck2013) and the open-source R package
   CLAM (Blaauw, Reference Blaauw2010). One-centimeter-thick slices of
   sediment were dried, homogenized, and analyzed via gamma spectroscopy
   using a Canberra GL2020 R low-energy gamma detector to determine ^137Cs
   and ^210Pb activity profiles for the upper 35 cm of the southern core
   sequence. The onset (1954 CE) of detectable ^137Cs and subsequent peak
   (1963 CE) provided two additional age-control points used in the final
   construction of an age–depth model for the composite sequence. In
   addition, the open-source R package serac (Bruel and Sabatier,
   Reference Bruel and Sabatier2020) was used to evaluate the ^210Pb
   profile using both the constant rate of supply (CRS; Appleby and
   Oldfield, Reference Appleby and Oldfield1978) and constant flux
   constant sedimentation (CFCS; Krishnaswamy et al., Reference
   Krishnaswamy, Lal, Martin and Meybeck1971) models. Ultimately, the
   sedimentation rate determined via application of the CFCS model was
   used to estimate the age (1890 ±10 yr) of the first prominent
   stratigraphic horizon that could be correlated among all cores (at
   33.5 cm depth in the southern composite sequence), providing one
   additional control point for the age–depth model.

   composite core sequences, including all possible calibrated age ranges
   and their probabilities based on the 95% confidence intervals of the
   radiocarbon ages.

   =]

   We used the three control points established from the ^137Cs and ^210Pb
   stratigraphies along with 10 radiocarbon dates to construct a final
   age–depth model for the southern composite sequence. A variety of
   age–depth modeling methods were investigated, including various
   interpolation methods using “classical” techniques (Blaauw, Reference
   Blaauw2010), Bayesian methods (Bacon; Blaauw and Christen, Reference
   Blaauw and Christen2011), and incorporation of time-varying
   accumulation rates derived from variations in sediment composition
   (Minderhoud et al., Reference Minderhoud, Cohen, Toonen, Erkens and
   Hoek2016). The results of our examination of differing age–depth models
   are described in detail by LeNoir (Reference LeNoir2019) and
   demonstrate that the primary interpretation of results is not altered
   by choice of age–depth modeling technique, though all models have
   shortcomings. As described herein, we utilized the age–depth model
   derived from linear interpolation between control points defined by the
   2-sigma uncertainty in the calibrated ages calculated in the R package
   CLAM (Blaauw, Reference Blaauw2010) and note the following caveats.
   Linear interpolation in CLAM underestimates the uncertainty in the age
   of sediment at most depths, produces (potentially spurious) inflection
   points in accumulation rate at each control point, and is unable to
   account for changes in sedimentation rate between control points,
   resulting in underestimation of peak accumulation rates during
   short-duration events. Nonetheless, linear interpolation in CLAM
   reduces subjective decision making around input parameters found in
   other models, and its shortcomings are predictable and can therefore be
   taken into consideration during interpretation of results.

   We examined changes in the mass accumulation rate of clastic sediment
   (MAR[clastic]) in Ossipee Lake as a proxy for suspended sediment yield
   (SSY) from the watershed using a similar approach to Cook et al.
   (Reference Cook, Snyder, Oswald and Paradis2020). MAR[clastic] per unit
   area of lake bottom (g/cm^2/yr) was determined using the equation:
   (Eq. 1)$${\rm MA}{\rm R}_{{\rm clastic}} = {\rm SR} \times
   \displaystyle{{{\rm \rho }_{{\rm db}}( {100-{\rm LOI}} ) } \over
   {100}}$$
   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAMLCwgAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw=
   =]

   where SR is the instantaneous bulk sedimentation rate (cm/yr) defined
   by the slope of the age–depth model and ρ[db] and LOI are the dry bulk
   density (g/cm^3) and percent mass loss on ignition, respectively, at
   corresponding depths. Estimates of SSY in Mg/yr/km^2 were derived from
   MAR[clastic] using the equation:
   (Eq. 2)$${\rm SSY} = {\rm MA}{\rm R}_{{\rm clastic}} \times
   \displaystyle{{{\rm LA}} \over {{\rm CA}}}\;\times 10, \;000\;{\rm
   Mg}/{\rm \;g}/{\rm c}{\rm m}^2/{\rm k}{\rm m}^2$$
   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAMLCwgAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw=
   =]

   where LA and CA are the lake area and catchment area, respectively.
   Rather than using the total surface area of the lake, we based LA on
   the area of the lake below the 8 m depth contour (7.5 km^2), the area
   within which the majority of Holocene sediment infill is observed based
   on interpretation of the subbottom sonar transects (Fig. 4).

   lake fill and proglacial lake sediments are identified along with a

RESULTS

   Subbottom sonar results from three W-E transects and a single N-S axial
   transect reveal more than 20 m of stratified deposits beneath Ossipee
   Lake (Fig. 4). Despite poor penetration in portions of the lake, likely
   due to gas present in the sediment, continuous, nearly horizontal
   acoustic reflections can be traced across large portions of the lake
   subbottom. The most prominent feature, identifiable in all subbottom
   sections, is a transition to stronger reflections at approximately 6 m
   below lake bottom (identified by the dashed green line in Fig. 4). The
   unit above this horizon tapers toward the lake margins and is generally
   limited to areas of the lake below ~8 m water depth. This unit is
   identified as the Holocene lake fill based on sedimentary and
   chronological evidence. The unit below this, characterized by prominent
   reflections, is interpreted as late-glacial lake sediment. An
   additional depositional unit in the southeastern portion of the lake is
   visible in transect 2017-1 (Fig. 4D), bounded above by the flat,
   shallow lake bottom in this portion of the lake and bounded below by
   the stratified late-glacial sediments. This unit appears nonconforming
   with the underlying late-glacial sediments and distinct from the
   Holocene lake fill. Field observations indicated that surface sediment
   in this shallow, southeastern portion of the lake are dominantly
   composed of sand.

   The lowermost sediment recovered from the southern basin, from 8.63 m
   to 6.90 m composite depth below lake bottom, is light gray in color and
   composed of diffuse silt and clay laminae with occasional black streaks
   (Fig. 5B). Organic content is low (LOI < 4.26%), ρ[db] varies from 0.82
   to 1.09 g/cm^3, and magnetic susceptibility ranges from 17.08 to
   191.24 × 10^−5 standard international units (SI) (Fig. 6). From 6.90 m
   to ~6.18 m, the organic content of the sediment progressively increases
   as ρ[db], magnetic susceptibility, and potassium content all decrease
   (Fig. 6). The depth of this transition from dense, inorganic sediment
   to lower-density, more organic-rich sediments is consistent with the
   prominent transition observed in the subbottom sonar at ~6 m below lake
   bottom, where more acoustically transparent material overlies a
   sequence of stronger reflections (Fig. 4).

   Figure 6. Core data from the southern composite sequence from Ossipee
   Lake. Analytical results span the upper 7.25 m. An additional 1.38 m of
   core was recovered and described, but not analyzed. Blue arrows
   indicate the position of radiocarbon dates; green arrows indicate
   control points derived from ^137Cs and ^210Pb profiles. Event layers
   (tan bands) are identified as intervals of decreased organic content
   (high LOI) and increased elevated minerogenic content (elevated ρ[db],
   magnetic susceptibility, and potassium). The portion shaded blue is
   interpreted as late-glacial deposits (modified from LeNoir, Reference
   LeNoir2019).

   The upper ~6.18 m of the southern composite core and the entire 2.31 m
   northern core sequence are composed primarily of dark brown, moderately
   organic (15–25% LOI), fine-grained (silty) sediment with a ρ[db]
   ranging from 0.17 to 0.46 g/cm^3 and magnetic susceptibility values
   ranging from 1.93 to 64.21 × 10^−5 SI (Figs. 5A and 6). Throughout the
   record, silicon and titanium covary and are strongly correlated (r
   ^2 = 0.82; Supplementary Fig. 3). The abundance of both elements
   broadly follows a similar pattern to LOI, magnetic susceptibility, and
   potassium (Fig. 6, Supplementary Fig. 3) and generally decrease from
   the earliest to latest periods of the record. The ratio of silicon to
   titanium decreases slightly over the course of the record, though low
   abundances of silicon above ~2.6 m were near or below the detection
   limit for the XRF instrument (as evident from occasional zero values
   for peak area counts) and likely result in spuriously low Si:Ti values
   for the portion of the record above 2.6 m.

   Dispersed intervals of lighter-brown sediment occur throughout the
   upper 6.18 m portion of the southern core. These intervals are enriched
   in clastic (minerogenic) sediment, as evident from a decrease in
   organic content (LOI excursions are 5–10% below that of underlying
   sediment) and increases in density, magnetic susceptibility, and
   potassium content (Figs. 5 and 6). These units are further
   characterized by sharp basal contacts that result in rapid excursions
   of proxy measurements that gradually return toward prior values,
   indicating compositional grading. We term these intervals “event
   deposits.” A total of 19 event deposits were identified in the southern
   composite sequence (Fig. 6). The uppermost event deposit, beginning at
   33.5 cm depth in the southern core and pictured in Figure 5A, is
   correlative among all cores we collected at both the southern and
   northern sites, also correlative are five underlying event deposits
   within the overlapping portion of the northern and southern records
   (LeNoir, Reference LeNoir2019; Supplementary Fig. 2). This uppermost
   event deposit was previously identified in multiple Ossipee Lake cores
   collected by Perello (Reference Perello2015), further demonstrating its
   widespread continuity. While we did not perform particle-size analysis,
   data from Perello (Reference Perello2015) indicate a slight decrease in
   median particle size from ~18 μm to 12 μm (dominated by an increase in
   clay content) at the base of the unit, followed by a gradual, but
   highly variable return above. Correlation of the event layers across
   the deep basin of the lake along with the continuous, parallel nature
   of reflections in the subbottom sonar data suggest widespread
   continuity of the sedimentary sequence in the central basin of Ossipee
   Lake.

   The combined results of the ^137Cs and ^210Pb stratigraphy and 10 ^14C
   ages from the southern composite sequence constrain the age–depth
   relationship of the sediment from ~12,000 cal yr BP to the collection
   date of the cores in 2017 CE (Fig. 7). The onset and subsequent peak of
   detectable ^137Cs at 14.5 cm and 11.5 cm, respectively, are in close
   agreement with the estimated ages of the sediment determined from both
   CRS and CFCS models of ^210Pb accumulation (Fig. 7). Below 25 cm, the
   CRS and CFCS age models diverge considerably. While the constant
   accumulation rate of the CFCS model is likely unrealistic, the marked
   decrease in accumulation rate below 25 cm implied by the CRS model is
   inconsistent with the core stratigraphy, which includes a prominent
   event deposit beginning at 30 cm in core 17-1 (composite depth of
   33.5 cm; Fig. 5A). We suspect that the most likely origin of the event
   deposit was increased deposition of clastic sediment, such that an age
   model requiring reduced accumulation through this interval is
   unrealistic. Consequently, we estimated the basal age of this event
   deposit from the CFCS age model as 1890 CE (acknowledging that the
   actual timing may be even younger) and incorporated this point in the
   age–depth model of the composite sequence. Over the 6.8 m interval of
   the composite sequence bracketed by age constraints (11,810 ± 210 cal
   yr BP to 2017 CE), the average linear accumulation rate is 0.06 cm/yr,
   with increased rates occurring after ~4000 cal yr BP and after ~1900
   CE.

   The accumulation rate of clastic sediment (MAR[clastic]; Fig. 8) varies
   throughout the record in accordance with changes in the slope of the
   age–depth model (Fig. 7) and variations in the density (ρ[db]) and
   composition (% LOI) of the sediment (Fig. 6). Given evidence in the
   subbottom sonar data for the accumulation of at least 15 m of sediment
   between deglaciation (circa 14,500 cal yr BP; Ridge et al., Reference
   Ridge, Canwell, Kelly and Kelley2001, Reference Ridge, Balco, Bayless,
   Beck, Carter, Dean, Voytek and Wei2012; Dalton et al., Reference
   Dalton, Margold, Stokes, Tarasov, Dyke, Adams and Allard2020; Ridge,
   Reference Ridge2022) and the transition to Holocene lake deposits,
   accumulation rates must have been at least 0.6 cm/yr from 14,500 to
   12,000 cal yr BP, yielding MAR[clastic] values higher than anything
   observed during the Holocene. From 11,810 to 9,000 cal yr BP
   MAR[clastic] decreases from ~0.16 g/cm^2/yr to 0.07 g/cm^2/yr in
   response to a decrease in the input of clastic sediment evident from
   the increasing LOI over this interval. From ~9000 cal yr BP to 1890 CE,
   MAR[clastic] varies widely from 0.07 g/cm^2/yr to 0.28 g/cm^2/yr, with
   the highest rates associated with distinct event deposits. Average
   MAR[clastic] is 0.014 g/cm^2/yr, yielding an estimated SSY from the
   watershed of 1.4 Mg/yr/km^2. A slightly increasing trend in
   MAR[clastic]of 0.002 g/cm^2/1000 yr is evident over this interval (r
   ^2 = 0.24, P value = 0.18; Fig. 8). The highest calculated MAR[clastic]
   values are observed after 1850 CE and are dominated by the presence of
   the prominent event deposit at 33.5 cm composite depth (Fig. 5A). Peak
   MAR[clastic] is 0.072 g/cm^2/yr and averages 0.035 g/cm^2/yr from 1850
   to 2017 CE, corresponding to a watershed SSY of 7.2 Mg/yr/km2 and 3.5
   Mg/yr/km^2, respectively. While MAR[clastic] since 1850 CE appears
   anomalous compared with the rest of the record, we note that this is
   the only portion of the record with centennial-scale age control. Given
   that the uppermost event deposit is unremarkable in terms of its
   density, LOI, or other indicators of composition, it is likely that
   actual peaks in MAR[clastic] in the earlier portion of the record would
   equal or exceed the values observed after1850 CE if deposition times
   could be constrained over similarly short intervals in the past.

   to AD 1890. Solid line depicts the slightly increasing trend in
   MAR[clastic] of 0.002 g/cm^2/1000 yr over this same interval (r
   ^2 = 0.24, P value = 0.18). The gray box from 1180 cal yr BP to the end
   of the record highlights the portion of the record beyond the
   bottommost age control point, where accumulation rate in the age–depth
   model is assumed to be the same as the section above it. Elevated
   MAR[clastic] in this portion of the record is a function of denser
   sediment (modified from LeNoir, Reference LeNoir2019).

DISCUSSION

   Our radiocarbon chronology indicates that the southern composite core
   sequence from Ossipee Lake spans the entire Holocene and includes
   ~1.7 m of clastic-rich gray sediment that we interpret to be late
   glacial in origin (Figs. 5 and 6). This allows us to consider
   paraglacial landscape evolution, as indicated by variability in the
   patterns of MAR[clastic] (Fig. 8), during the entire Holocene and
   through the period of Euro-American land-use change. Strong covariance
   among LOI, magnetic susceptibility, potassium, silicon, and titanium
   (Fig 6; Supplementary Fig. 3) supports our interpretation of variations
   in MAR[clastic] as primarily reflecting changes in terrestrial sediment
   input. However, we acknowledge that interpreting terrestrial processes
   from limited cores is fraught with uncertainty (e.g., Davis and Ford,
   Reference Davis and Ford1982). Nonetheless, there are several lines of
   evidence supporting the interpretation of our Ossipee Lake sequence in
   terms of landscape evolution. First, the lateral continuity of strata
   identified in the subbottom data (Fig. 4) and between our northern and
   southern core sites (LeNoir, Reference LeNoir2019; Supplementary Figs.
   1 and 2) suggests that depositional patterns within the deep basin are
   spatially consistent. Second, the relatively large size of Ossipee Lake
   and the position of our coring sites away from active deltas lead us to
   believe that we are sampling fine-grained sediment delivered primarily
   in suspension by the inflowing rivers. Delivery of sediment to these
   distal locations is likely dominated by prevailing westerly winds and
   flow of water from tributaries on the western side of the lake to the
   outlet in the eastern corner of the lake. This is in contrast to more
   marginal locations in the lake subject to slope processes and more
   sensitive to delta migration. Finally, subbottom sonar data reveal that
   the present-day bathymetry characterized by a broad, flat central basin
   mimics the underlying surface, marking the boundary between
   late-glacial and Holocene deposits, which are nearly constant in
   thickness in the central portion of the lake (Fig. 4). Consequently,
   Holocene infilling of the lake from a maximum water depth of ~25 m to
   the present 19.5 m water depth is unlikely to have resulted in widely
   shifting depocenters or trapping efficiencies. While we cannot
   definitively rule out the possible influence of long-term delta
   progradation on MAR[clastic], we emphasize the distal setting of our
   coring sites and the fact that the package of Holocene sediment visible
   in the subbottom data reveals no apparent thinning to the south or east
   as might be expected if proximity to primary deltas played a major role
   in determining accumulation rates. Consequently, the discussion that
   follows is based on the assumption that changes in MAR[clastic]
   predominantly reflect changes in the terrestrial suspended sediment
   delivered to Ossipee Lake from its watershed.

Late-glacial landscape evolution

   The initial period of elevated MAR[clastic] followed by the transition
   from dominantly minerogenic to more organic-rich sediment and
   accompanying decline in MAR[clastic] from the earliest part of our
   record to ~9200 ± 200 cal yr BP (Fig. 9) reflects the most pronounced
   interval of paraglacial landscape adjustment in the Ossipee watershed.
   The thickness of the pre-Holocene deposits evident in our subbottom
   data (Fig. 4) necessitate a >0.6 cm/yr linear sedimentation rate over
   some portion of 14,500 to 12,000 cal yr BP, as constrained by our
   lowermost radiocarbon date and the timing of regional deglaciation.
   This rate is roughly an order of magnitude higher than the mean
   sedimentation rate over the Holocene. Extremely high accumulation rates
   in proglacial settings are common (Desloges and Gilbert, Reference
   Desloges and Gilbert1991; Gilbert and Desloges, Reference Gilbert and
   Desloges1992) and are consistent with readily available surface
   deposits on the freshly deglaciated landscape, abundant meltwater for
   transporting sediment, and a lack of vegetation to help stabilize
   surface deposits. Consequently, it is likely that much of the
   pre-Holocene sediments were deposited in a proglacial setting,
   immediately following ice retreat.

   and Southon2002; Noren et al., Reference Noren, Bierman, Steig, Lini
   and Southon2002; Parris et al., Reference Parris, Bierman, Noren, Prins
   and Lini2010), alluvial fans (Jennings et al., Reference Jennings,
   Bierman and Southon2003), and floodplains (Lombardi et al., Reference
   Lombardi, Davis, Stinchcomb, Munoz, Stewart and Therrell2020); (D)
   regional climate reconstructions (Shuman and Marsicek, Reference Shuman

   vegetation history (Shuman et al., Reference Shuman, Newby, Donnelly,
   Tarbox and Webb2005; figure modified from LeNoir, Reference
   LeNoir2019).

   The continuation of elevated MAR[clastic] even after the regional ice
   margin had retreated beyond the watershed boundary reflects ongoing
   paraglacial adjustments, likely including a pronounced period of stream
   incision driven by a combination of lake-level reduction, vegetation
   establishment, and glacial isostatic adjustments. Evidence for a higher
   lake level early in the deglaciation of the Ossipee Valley is provided
   by elevated shoreline features and paleo-drainage channels near the
   present lake outlet (Newton, Reference Newton1974a, Reference
   Newton1974b; Fig. 2). We see no sedimentological evidence of a
   lake-level reduction event within the core sequence that we collected
   and surmise that paleolake drainage likely occurred shortly after
   deglaciation (ca. 14,500 cal yr BP; Ridge et al., Reference Ridge,
   Balco, Bayless, Beck, Carter, Dean, Voytek and Wei2012) and no later
   than 11,810 ± 210 cal yr BP, the age of our lowest radiocarbon date.
   The Saco River valley, the next major drainage to the north of Ossipee
   Lake, was occupied by a series of small glacial lakes collectively
   referred to as Lake Pigwacket (Thompson, Reference Thompson1999),
   thought to have drained between 12,170 and 11,630 cal yr BP (Shuman et
   al., Reference Shuman, Newby, Donnelly, Tarbox and Webb2005). Falling
   lake level of an enlarged postglacial Ossipee Lake would not have
   isolated the lake basin from the dominant drainage networks supplying
   sediment to the lake. In contrast, lake-level reduction would have
   decreased the regional base level, initiated the widespread fluvial
   incision and gullying prevalent throughout the watershed (Fig. 2), and
   consequently increased sediment delivery to the lake, as evident from
   elevated MAR[clastic] in Figures 8 and 9. Pollen data from Echo Lake,
   located 30 km north of Ossipee Lake, are dominated by spruce (Picea)
   before 13,000 cal yr BP, transitioning through boreal taxa such as
   alder (Alnus), fir (Abies), and birch (Betula), before becoming
   dominated by haploxylon pine and oak (Quercus) by 11,000 cal yr BP
   (Shuman et al., Reference Shuman, Newby, Donnelly, Tarbox and Webb2005;
   Fig. 9E). These data reveal the establishment and evolution of the
   regional forest cover, which would have helped stabilize hillslopes,
   strengthen stream banks, and promote a transition from braided to
   meandering planforms as stream channels incised to the base level of
   the modern lake (Newton, Reference Newton1974a, Reference Newton1974b;
   Moore and Medalie, Reference Moore and Medalie1995; Fig. 2). In
   addition, differential rebound of 0.9 m/km resulting from retreat of
   the Laurentide Ice Sheet (Hooke and Ridge, Reference Hooke and
   Ridge2016) would have steepened the gradients of south-flowing streams,
   including the Bearcamp River, the largest tributary to Ossipee Lake,
   which drains the highest elevation and steepest portions of the
   watershed. Therefore, lake-level reduction, vegetation establishment,
   and isostatic adjustments may have all contributed to fluvial incision.
   The decrease in MAR[clastic] beginning ~12,000 cal yr BP (Figs. 8 and
   9) suggests that channel profiles may have begun stabilizing by this
   time, a pattern that is consistent with a period of most active fluvial
   incision in the earliest Holocene observed in the Missisquoi River
   valley in northern Vermont (Brakenridge et al., Reference Brakenridge,
   Thomas, Conkey and Schiferle1988) and the Connecticut River valley in
   southern New England (Schenck, Reference Schenck2018).

Early Holocene landscape changes

   We interpret the interval of decreasing MAR[clastic] from ~12,000 to
   9000 cal yr BP (Figs. 8A and 9A) as reflecting the waning influence of
   the prior glacial conditioning of the landscape. During this interval,
   stream channel profiles likely approached equilibrium with the base
   level defined by the modern elevation of Ossipee Lake, the most readily
   erodible surface deposits were being exhausted, and the regional
   vegetation transitioned from boreal taxa to a forest dominated by oak
   (Quercus), beech (Fagus), birch (Betula), and hemlock (Tsuga) that
   persisted through the remainder of the Holocene (Shuman et al.,
   Reference Shuman, Newby, Donnelly, Tarbox and Webb2005; Fig. 9E). Our
   inferred timing for stabilization of the landscape surrounding Ossipee
   Lake, ~9200 ± 200 cal yr BP, aligns with the establishment of maximum
   vegetation coverage within the Mirror Lake, New Hampshire, watershed
   around 9500 to 9000 cal yr BP (Likens and Davis, Reference Likens and
   Davis1975). The >5 ka time interval from deglaciation to apparent
   landscape stabilization around 9200 cal yr BP is consistent with the
   extended timescales of paraglacial sediment reworking demonstrated for
   glaciated British Columbia river basins (Church and Slaymaker,
   Reference Church and Slaymaker1989). The shape of the Ossipee Lake
   MAR[clastic] curve during this interval is consistent with an
   exhaustion model of paraglacial landscape evolution (Ballantyne,
   Reference Ballantyne2002), in which the supply of easily mobilized
   sediment decreases as the landscape stabilizes. However, lacking the
   detailed age control within this interval needed to adequately
   constrain short-duration variations in sediment yield, we cannot rule
   out an evolution dominated by waves of erosion, as suggested by Church
   and Ryder (Reference Church and Ryder1972). Notably, the variable
   MAR[clastic] pattern and episodic occurrence of event deposits
   throughout the Holocene (Figs. 8A and 9A) suggest ongoing reworking of
   glaciogenic deposits throughout the study period.

Middle through Late Holocene landscape evolution

   The Ossipee Lake record of MAR[clastic] from ~9000 cal yr BP to ~1850
   CE is highly variable, but contains a slight trend toward increasing
   MAR[clastic] (Figs. 8A and 9A). Interestingly, the lowest values of
   MAR[clastic] during the entire record are observed around ~9000 cal yr
   BP, corresponding to a period of increased fire activity in southern
   New England during what was broadly the warmest and driest interval of
   the Holocene (Oswald et al., Reference Oswald, Foster, Shuman, Chilton,
   Doucette and Duranleau2020). While we cannot rule out short-duration
   increases in erosion and subsequent lake sedimentation in response to
   individual wildfires, the occurrence of the lowest MAR[clastic] values
   during the period of greatest regional fire activity suggests that on
   centennial or longer timescales, fire frequency is not a primary driver
   of erosion rates. In general, variations in MAR[clastic] reflect the
   combined influence of the sedimentation rate defined by the slope of
   the age–depth model and variations in the composition of the sediment.
   Though discrete peaks in MAR[clastic] are associated with the
   occurrence of event deposits (Fig. 9A) characterized by enriched
   minerogenic content (Fig. 9B), variations in the timing and frequency
   of event deposits are independent of millennial-scale changes in
   MAR[clastic] and the long-term increasing trend in MAR[clastic].

   To further explore the origins of millennial-scale changes in
   MAR[clastic], we compiled existing Holocene-length records of
   terrestrial sedimentation in the northeastern United States (Fig. 9C)
   from lakes (Brown et al., Reference Brown, Bierman, Lini, Davis and
   Southon2002; Noren et al., Reference Noren, Bierman, Steig, Lini and
   Southon2002; Parris et al., Reference Parris, Bierman, Noren, Prins and
   Lini2010), alluvial fans (Jennings et al., Reference Jennings, Bierman
   and Southon2003), and floodplains (Lombardi et al., Reference Lombardi,
   Davis, Stinchcomb, Munoz, Stewart and Therrell2020). Though these
   records reveal limited internal consistency, we note that the apparent
   periods of elevated terrestrial sediment redistribution in the regional
   records centered around ~6500 cal yr BP and ~2500 cal yr BP and
   separated by a multimillennial period of reduced activity are generally
   consistent with the pattern of MAR[clastic] in Ossipee Lake. In
   contrast, the long-term trend of increasing MAR[clastic] at Ossipee
   Lake is not observed in other regional records of terrestrial
   sedimentation. Both increasing MAR[clastic] over the Holocene and the
   episodic occurrence of event deposits (Figs. 8 and 9A) are contrary to
   simple exhaustion models of paraglacial sedimentation (e.g.,
   Ballantyne, Reference Ballantyne2002) and instead reveal persistent or
   intermittent reworking of the landscape throughout the Holocene, as was
   observed in the Scottish Highlands by Ballantyne (Reference
   Ballantyne2008).

   While the increasing trend in MAR[clastic] over the Middle and Late
   Holocene is weak, the possibility that sediment export from the
   watershed was increasing, or even remaining constant, warrants further
   exploration, as sediment availability in this paraglacial landscape
   should theoretically have been decreasing (e.g., Ballantyne, Reference
   Ballantyne2002). An increase in biogenic silica production within the
   lake or its preservation in sediment over the course of the Holocene
   would impact our LOI-based determinations of the inorganic fraction of
   the sediment and subsequent calculations of MAR[clastic], yielding a
   spurious trend toward increasing MAR[clastic] over the same interval.
   However, strong covariance of silicon and other indicators of
   terrestrial sediment (Fig. 6, Supplementary Fig. 3) suggests that
   variations in the inorganic fraction of the sediment in Ossipee Lake
   are dominated by changes in terrestrial sediment input. Furthermore, a
   gradual decrease in Si:Ti over the Holocene is suggested by our XRF
   data, though we emphasize the qualitative nature of these results
   (Supplementary Fig. 3). This pattern could result from decreasing
   production of biogenic silica in the lake, decreased preservation in
   the sediment, or dilution of biogenic silica by increased input of
   silicon from terrestrial sources (Conley and Schelske, Reference
   Conley, Schelske, Smol, Birks, Last, Bradley and Alverson2002). All of
   these possibilities are consistent with the observed increase in
   MAR[clastic] resulting from increased input of clastic sediment from
   the watershed rather than any increase in the amount of biogenic silica
   in the sediment.

   Assuming that the apparent increasing trend in MAR[clastic] over the
   Middle and Late Holocene truly reflects changing delivery of sediment
   from the watershed, we explore several plausible mechanisms capable of
   driving changes in sediment yield from the surrounding landscape.
   Regional pollen records (Shuman et al., Reference Shuman, Newby,
   Donnelly, Tarbox and Webb2005; Oswald et al., Reference Oswald, Foster,
   Shuman, Chilton, Doucette and Duranleau2020; Fig. 9E) reveal changes in
   vegetation throughout the Holocene; however, we see no obvious trend in
   vegetation that might lead to increasing sediment availability and a
   subsequent increase in MAR[clastic] in Ossipee Lake. The long history
   of human habitation in the Ossipee region and the potential for human
   modification of the landscape to have produced changes in sediment
   yield over at least the past several millennia (e.g., Dearing and
   Jones, Reference Dearing and Jones2003) provide another possible
   mechanism to explain the long-term trend in MAR[clasti][c]. However,
   indigenous populations in the region reached maxima during the Late
   Archaic (5000–3000 cal yr BP) and Middle–Late Woodland (1500–500 cal yr
   BP) periods (Munoz et al., Reference Munoz, Gajewski and Peros2010),
   which is inconsistent with the timing of peak MAR[clastic] in Ossipee
   Lake. An additional mechanism that could account for the long-term
   increase in MAR[clastic] is glacial isostatic adjustments affecting
   river gradients, base level, and/or the position of drainage divides. A
   forebulge would have existed 150–200 km south of the Laurentide Ice
   Sheet margin (Hooke et al., Reference Hooke, Hanson, Belknap and
   Kelley2017) and migrated north as ice retreated (Hooke and Ridge,
   Reference Hooke and Ridge2016). In Maine, the forebulge migrated from
   the coast to the Moosehead Lake region between 12,200 and 9500 cal yr
   BP at a rate of ~67 m/yr (Balco et al., Reference Balco, Belknap and
   Kelley1998). Combining this knowledge with constraints on the timing of
   ice margin positions in the vicinity of Ossipee Lake (Ridge et al.,
   Reference Ridge, Canwell, Kelly and Kelley2001, Reference Ridge, Balco,
   Bayless, Beck, Carter, Dean, Voytek and Wei2012; Dalton et al.,
   Reference Dalton, Margold, Stokes, Tarasov, Dyke, Adams and
   Allard2020), the forebulge likely migrated through the region before
   9000 cal yr BP, limiting the potential impact of isostatic adjustments
   on subsequent sediment delivery.

   Finally, we hypothesize that the most likely origin of any long-term
   increase in MAR[clastic] is the concomitant long-term increase in
   effective precipitation that occurred during the Holocene in this
   region (Shuman and Marsicek, Reference Shuman and Marsicek2016; Fig.
   9D). This relationship suggests that moisture balance serves as an
   important control on long-term watershed erosion rates and is
   consistent with other regional observations relating differences in the
   sediment yield from individual hydrologic events (Yellen et al.,
   Reference Yellen, Woodruff, Cook and Newton2016) and centennial-scale
   variability in erosion (Cook et al., Reference Cook, Yellen, Woodruff
   and Miller2015) to changes in underlying moisture balance. Such an
   increase in sediment yield necessitates the continued availability of
   easily reworked sediment (evident from the abundance of glacigenic
   deposits blanketing the watershed) and is consistent with Church and
   Slaymaker's (Reference Church and Slaymaker1989) observation that
   rivers in British Columbia are still responding to the last glaciation.

Historic-era land-use impacts and the origin of event deposits

   MAR[clastic] increases abruptly at ~1890 CE, with the highest
   accumulation rates of the entire record observed within the last
   century and a half (Fig. 8). The inferred SSY peak of 7.2 Mg/yr/km^2
   and 1850–2017 CE mean of 3.5 Mg/yr/km^2 nonetheless remain low relative
   to some rates proposed for other forested watersheds in the eastern
   United States (Patric et al., Reference Patric, Evans and Helvey1984).
   And while the recent increase in sediment yield might be expected based
   on the history of Euro-American settlement and land-use change in the
   region, and is consistent with human impacts in other regions (e.g.,
   Davis, Reference Davis1976; Dearing et al., Reference Dearing,
   Håkansson, Liedberg-Jönsson, Persson, Skansjö, Widholm and
   El-Daoushy1987; Heathcote et al., Reference Heathcote, Filstrup and
   Downing2013), our attribution of the increase in MAR[clastic] in
   Ossipee Lake to human land-use change must be tempered. First, our
   age–depth model provides limited resolution for constraining
   calculations of MAR[clastic], and the abrupt increase in MAR[clastic]
   is partially an artifact of an inflection point in the age–depth model
   at the base of the uppermost event deposit. Nonetheless, the event
   deposit is characterized by increased clastic content and increased
   bulk density, such that an increase in MAR[clastic] would exist even if
   the sedimentation rate (SR) remained constant throughout this interval.
   However, the anomalous nature of recent MAR[clastic] would be less
   extreme relative to earlier event deposits if age control was
   continuously well resolved over the entire record.

   A second important consideration when interpreting the recent increase
   in MAR[clastic] is the origin of the uppermost event deposit, the most
   prominent stratigraphic feature of the past 500 yr (Figs. 5 and 9A), as
   well as other event deposits throughout the record. We assigned an age
   of 1890 ± 10 CE to the base of this event, based on interpretation of
   our ^210Pb and ^137Cs profiles. If the increase in clastic content
   defining this feature was a consequence of Euro-American land-use
   change increasing sediment delivery to the lake, then the timing
   appears several decades late relative to the 1860 CE maximum in Carroll
   County population and associated agricultural activity (Merrill,
   Reference Merrill1889). Uncertainty in our age–depth model could
   facilitate shifting the onset of this event layer earlier. However,
   doing so would result in a decrease in the calculated sedimentation
   rate between the base of the event layer and the first observed fallout
   of ^137Cs in 1954 relative to the sedimentation rate between 1954 and
   the core top; an outcome deemed implausible given the pattern of
   clastic deposition over these intervals. Furthermore, the abrupt nature
   of the basal contact of the event deposit (Figs. 5 and 9B) suggests a
   near instantaneous transition in sedimentation; a pattern that is
   inconsistent with a gradual increase in deforestation and agricultural
   land use and contrasts with existing records of sedimentation that show
   a gradual increase in clastic input in response to human land-use
   change (e.g., Davis, Reference Davis1976; Dearing et al., Reference
   Dearing, Håkansson, Liedberg-Jönsson, Persson, Skansjö, Widholm and
   El-Daoushy1987; Francis and Foster, Reference Francis and Foster2001;
   Heathcote et al., Reference Heathcote, Filstrup and Downing2013) The
   abrupt nature of this and other event deposits suggests possible
   deposition from a sediment gravity flow (e.g., Gani, Reference
   Gani2004), originating either subaqueously or triggered by events in
   the watershed. However, the fine particle size and absence of textural
   grading within the uppermost event deposit as reported by Perello
   (Reference Perello2015) is inconsistent with most deposits resulting
   from density flows (Gani, Reference Gani2004). In contrast, the
   compositional grading from highly clastic to increasingly organic-rich
   sediment observed in all event deposits (Fig. 6) is similar to deposits
   observed in Amherst Lake, Vermont (Cook et al., Reference Cook, Yellen,
   Woodruff and Miller2015). In that setting, event deposits were linked
   to periods of elevated input of clastic sediment from the watershed
   initiated by extreme floods and followed by a period of decreasing
   clastic input as the landscape gradually recovered from the initial
   disturbance (Cook et al., Reference Cook, Yellen, Woodruff and
   Miller2015). Cook et al. (Reference Cook, Yellen, Woodruff and
   Miller2015, Reference Cook, Snyder, Oswald and Paradis2020) were able
   to correlate distinct event deposits to landscape disturbances related
   to historical floods in Vermont and Maine, respectively. In contrast,
   we were unable to link the uppermost event deposit in Ossipee Lake to
   any known historical flood event or other landscape disturbance.
   Indeed, with only one event deposit having occurred within last 500 yr
   in Ossipee Lake, we found no clear signature of any historical flood
   events, forest fires, or other known disturbances in the record. While
   the origin of the event deposits remains enigmatic, we hypothesize that
   they reflect abrupt increases in erosion caused by the most extreme
   hydrologic events triggering landslides in the uplands and/or avulsions
   and other adjustments in the fluvial network closer to the lake and/or
   the stochastic interaction of a laterally migrating stream channel
   occasionally intersecting a new repository of erodible sediment.

   Overall, the infrequent occurrence of event deposits, averaging only 1
   per ~500 yr over the Holocene, and the apparently modest SSY over the
   past century portray a landscape only moderately sensitive to
   disturbances. In contrast to other watersheds, where both distinct
   floods (Cook et al., Reference Cook, Yellen, Woodruff and Miller2015,
   Reference Cook, Snyder, Oswald and Paradis2020) and changes in land use
   (Cook et al., Reference Cook, Snyder, Oswald and Paradis2020) are
   clearly recorded in lacustrine archives, Ossipee Lake and its watershed
   are considerably larger than those focused on by other studies in the
   region. Sediment entering a larger waterbody may be distributed over a
   larger area, potentially muting the depositional signature. The large
   area of the Ossipee watershed also provides more opportunity for
   trapping and storage of sediment in lakes, wetlands, and floodplains
   and behind dams upstream of the lake. The Amherst Lake and Little
   Kennebago Lake watersheds studied by Cook et al. (Reference Cook,
   Yellen, Woodruff and Miller2015, Reference Cook, Snyder, Oswald and
   Paradis2020), respectively, were both characterized by steeper average
   slopes and fewer upstream water bodies likely to trap fine sediment
   relative to the Ossipee watershed. Despite these factors, Euro-American
   settlers were undoubtedly modifying the regional landscape over the
   past 250+ yr, and at least some of the sediment liberated by land-use
   changes has likely contributed to elevated MAR[clastic] since at least
   1890 CE. The increasing content of clastic material in the centuries
   preceding the uppermost event deposit, evident from decreasing LOI and
   increasing ρ[db], magnetic susceptibility, and potassium (Fig. 6), may
   record the subtle, early impacts of Euro-American land-use changes.
   Collectively, these results suggest that while both hydrologic and
   human disturbances to the landscape may increase sediment availability
   and mobilize sediment in portions of a watershed, the export of
   fine-grained sediment from the largest watersheds in the region likely
   displays a muted response to landscape disturbances. This finding has
   important implications regarding the potential magnitude of the impacts
   from Euro-American land-use changes on the redistribution of sediment
   across the northeastern United States over the past few centuries.

CONCLUSIONS

   Ossipee Lake preserves a continuous record of watershed erosion
   spanning the late glacial and the entirety of the Holocene through the
   period of regional Euro-American settlement. Variability in
   sedimentation throughout the record reflects ongoing paraglacial
   landscape adjustment. The period of most active landscape adjustment
   persisted until ~12,000 cal yr BP. Decreasing mass accumulation of
   clastic sediment from 12,000 to ~9000 cal yr BP reflects the gradual
   stabilization of the landscape as river channels approached equilibrium
   profiles, extensive forests were established, and the most readily
   available sediment supplies were exhausted or isolated. An apparent
   trend of increasing sediment yield from 9000 cal yr BP through 1850 CE
   is consistent with increasing effective precipitation over this period
   and suggests a dominant hydroclimatic control of erosion on long
   timescales. However, the overall sediment yield and magnitude of
   changes in sediment yield from the Ossipee watershed remain low
   throughout the Holocene, suggesting a relatively low sensitivity to
   change and minimal impact from millennial-scale changes in vegetation
   or regional fire frequency. A muted response to Euro-American land-use
   changes and lack of distinct depositional signatures related to known
   extreme floods or historical land-use activity further reflect the lake
   and watershed system's limited sensitivity to disturbances. Downstream
   export of fine-grained sediment is limited by trapping and storage
   among hillslope, floodplain, lake, and wetland depocenters that become
   increasingly abundant as watershed size increases. This result suggests
   that the export of fine-grained sediment from the largest watersheds in
   the region likely experienced a modest response to Holocene landscape
   changes.

   core was recovered and described, but not analyzed. Blue arrows
   indicate the position of radiocarbon dates; green arrows indicate
   control points derived from 137Cs and 210Pb profiles. Event layers (tan
   bands) are identified as intervals of decreased organic content (high
   LOI) and increased elevated minerogenic content (elevated ρdb, magnetic
   susceptibility, and potassium). The portion shaded blue is interpreted
   as late-glacial deposits (modified from LeNoir, 2019).

   MARclastic of 0.002 g/cm2/1000 yr over this same interval (r2 = 0.24, P
   value = 0.18). The gray box from 1180 cal yr BP to the end of the
   record highlights the portion of the record beyond the bottommost age
   control point, where accumulation rate in the age–depth model is
   assumed to be the same as the section above it. Elevated MARclastic in
   this portion of the record is a function of denser sediment (modified
