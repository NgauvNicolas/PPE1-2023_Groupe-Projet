   Why hasn’t evolution given us eyes in the back of our head or rear-view
   mirrors?

--

   You can look at it another way. Rear vision is useful only if potential
   threats are visible. During human evolution, that was most often not
   the case.

--

   There are various aspects to this question. First, it supposes
   evolution works towards particular goals in a planned way, but that
   isn’t the case.

--

   It may therefore be that the architecture of our central nervous system
   has simply not lent itself to the evolution of an extra pair of eyes in
   the back of our head.
