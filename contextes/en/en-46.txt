   changes in the selective environments of organisms across the tree of
   life. Our collective understanding about biological evolution can help
   identify and mitigate many of the environmental problems in the
   Anthropocene. To this end, we propose a stronger integration of
   environmental sciences with evolutionary biology.

   All ecosystems, be they natural or engineered, contain biological
   organisms that are bound by the principles of biological evolution. As
   such, biological evolution is often a central feature of many problems
   that are currently being tackled by environmental scientists. Yet
   fundamental principles from the discipline of evolutionary biology are
   rarely used in the analysis and mitigation of environmental problems,
   even when evolutionary processes are closely linked to their
   manifestation (Carroll et al., 2014; Jørgensen et al., 2019).
   Environmental scientists are particularly adept at reaching across
   disciplines to ensure that they have the knowledge and tools necessary
   to tackle complex environmental problems. Here we propose that a wider
   application of principles of evolutionary biology would help us achieve
   more sustainable solutions to environmental problems.

   In brief, evolution is a process of heritable change in the phenotype
   of a population of organisms (Box 1). While evolution can result from
   random genetic drift (representing “neutral” evolution), here we focus
   on adaptive evolution, defined as a change in population mean fitness
   in response to natural selection (Box 1). Genetic and trait variation,
   and how such variation changes over time and space, are fundamental
   properties of living systems. There is mounting evidence that evolution
   is sufficiently fast in natural populations to be highly relevant for
   understanding how populations will respond to human-mediated

   Applying evolutionary principles to understand environmental problems
   is not a novel idea (Gunderson and Holling, 2002, Santamaria and
   Mendez, 2012), but widespread application is still limited (Jørgensen
   et al., 2019). In the context of the biodiversity crisis ecologists are
   increasingly using evolutionary theory to help mitigate the loss of
   genetic and species diversity due to climate change and environmental
   pollution (Bell and Gonzalez, 2009; Kristensen et al., 2018).
   Evolutionary theory is also critical to understanding the emergence of
   antibiotic resistance in microbes (Palmer and Kishony, 2013) and
   chemical resistance in pests (Fisher et al., 2018). Plainly,
   evolutionary theory can be highly relevant to pertinent environmental
   problems, but it is not broadly applied. There is a frequent use of
   methods and technologies originating from evolutionary biology. In
   particular, molecular genetic methods are often used to characterise
   microbial community composition (Das and Dash, 2019), and the patterns
--
   al., 2017). While such methods are undeniably useful to gain functional
   insights, they are rarely used in environmental science to study
   evolutionary processes. The potential for evolutionary applications in
   environmental sciences is far reaching, and in the next sections we
   focus on core concepts of evolution and exemplify how they can be
   applied to a range of environmental problems in aquatic ecosystems.

1.1. The structure of evolutionary processes

   The structure and rate of change of heritable trait variation in living
--
   by genes (so called genotype-phenotype maps; (Houle et al., 2010)).
   Individuals interact within populations, where average trait values
   change through evolutionary and environmental processes (Burns, 1992;
   Frank, 2011; Pedersen and Tuomi, 1995), and populations interact and
   evolve within multi-species communities (Weber et al., 2017). As a
--
   contribute to maladaptation of natural populations and thereby can
   potentially hinder conservation efforts (Leitwein et al., 2019).
   Despite the long held view that evolution is a slow process, it is now
   well established that the pace of heritable trait change can be
   sufficiently fast to affect population dynamics, species interactions,
   and ecosystem processes - i.e. evolution can act at ecological time
   scales (Hairston et al., 2005; Stockwell et al., 2003). The dynamics of
   species interactions in natural communities are hence not simply a
   product of past evolution. Rather, evolutionary processes can shape
   trait distributions of populations (i.e. mean and variance) at a pace
   that is highly relevant for many environmental problems.

   Evolutionary processes can either ameliorate or exacerbate
   environmental problems. Evolutionary adaptation, for example, can drive
   the recovery of populations, or even multi-species communities, from
   decline, in a process known as “evolutionary rescue” (Bell and
   Gonzalez, 2009; Low-Décarie et al., 2015). In natural populations,
   evolution has rescued killifish from chemical pollution (Whitehead et
   al., 2017) and amphibians from acidification (Hangartner et al., 2012).
   In these cases, genetic adaptation has allowed for the persistence of
   populations in environments that would otherwise be unsuitable.
   Evolutionary novelty can also emerge in populations exposed to
   synthetic environments created by humans, and, in doing so, perform
   essential evosystem services (Rudman et al., 2017). For example, the
--
   in Germany (Kahl et al., 2018), possibly associated with a microbial
   consortium of proteobacterial species (Fig. 1 ). Identifying the
   evolutionary processes governing such bioremediation dynamics could
   help address the persistence of chemicals in our natural environments
   for which engineering solutions are lacking. On the other hand,
   evolutionary processes can also create novel environmental problems, or
   worsen existing ones. For example, the emergence and amplification of
   antibiotic resistance genes is a global problem, caused by the
   widespread overuse of antibiotics (Palmer and Kishony, 2013). In
   wastewater treatment plants, the concentration of antibiotic resistance
   genes may be amplified by evolution prior to water discharge into
   natural aquatic environments (Ju et al., 2019) (Fig. 1). Understanding
   and monitoring the evolutionary process in wastewater treatment plants
   could improve our ability to limit the release of antibiotic resistance
   genes into natural environments (Czekalski et al., 2015).

   treatment plant (WWTP) can either cause a beneficial reduction in a
   pollutant concentration (ACE: the artificial sweetener Acesulfame) due
   to the evolution of catabolism of novel/synthetic compounds, or an
   unwanted increase in resistance genes in a microbial population due to
   positive selection in the treatment plant (Figure design by Peter
--

   In this section, we illustrate how a broader application of
   evolutionary theory can enable environmental scientists to craft better
   solutions for environmental problems. To this end, we use four examples
   from aquatic systems: (i) emergence and epidemiology of disease, (ii)
--
   outbreaks of algal blooms.

2.1. Disease dynamics in natural populations: when evolution kills or cures

   Diseases are among the most severe environmental problems. They are a
--
   (Engering et al., 2013; Longdon et al., 2014). Most disease-causing
   organisms have large populations and short generation times, which
   generally facilitates rapid evolution. Consequently, disease emergence
   typically involves rapid co-evolutionary dynamics that stem from
   natural selection on both pathogen infectivity and host defense
   (Penczykowski et al., 2016). Rapid evolutionary dynamics are expected
   to take place at the onset of disease emergence, governed by the
   pathogens' and the hosts' evolutionary history.

   Disease emergence is often a consequence of human activities. Transport
   between continents can bring pathogens into naïve host populations that
   are, at least initially, defenseless; they can lack sufficient genetic
   variation for resistance because they do not have coevolutionary
   history with these pathogens. The crayfish plague provides a good
   example. Aphanomyces astaci, a pathogen of freshwater crayfish native
   to North America came to Europe with introduced American crayfish
   (Svoboda et al., 2017). American crayfish species had evolved a high
   tolerance of the pathogen, due to their long evolutionary history, but
   the pathogen proved devastating to stocks of European freshwater
   crayfish species (Holdich et al., 2009). Likewise, human activities
--
   locally highly virulent pathogens (Stukenbrock and McDonald, 2008). For
   example, large monocultures of genetically homogenous plants can
   facilitate the evolution of host specialization (McDonald and
   Stukenbrock, 2016), leading to evolutionary dynamics that are not
   commonly observed in natural ecosystems.

   Evolutionary theory can be instrumental in helping to understand the
   origin and spread of diseases through populations. Increasingly,
   researchers can track disease dynamics over time by comparing genetic
--
   bacterial and fungal diseases, but in some cases a single new drug can
   cause strong natural selection, and, combined with the high
   evolutionary potential of pathogens, this means that the expected time
   until drug resistance evolves can be short (Fisher et al., 2018;
   Kennedy and Read, 2018). For such scenarios, we need to develop
   evolution-aware strategies to avoid and control emergent diseases. For
   example, in the case of chemical treatments, combination therapy or the
   sequential application of different drugs can delay resistance
   evolution (Palmer and Kishony, 2013; Roemhild et al., 2018), and the
   development of ‘evolution-proof’ drugs is a particularly attractive
   idea (Bell and MacLean, 2018). Alternative strategies include fighting
   the disease with agents that are able to evolve themselves, such as
--
   (Kueneman et al., 2016).

2.2. Renewable biofuels: when evolution fills our tanks

   The dwindling supply and the negative environmental impact of fossil
--
   The ideal species for maximum production would be unconstrained by the
   trade-offs inherent to all living systems. Yet such omnipotent
   organisms, known in evolutionary biology as Darwinian demons (Krakauer,
   2011; Law, 1979), do not exist and cannot be engineered. Nevertheless,
   sustainable yield of biofuels could be optimized by understanding the
--
   confer resistance to parasites, and are resistant to grazers (Shurin et
   al., 2013, Shurin et al., 2016; T. Yoshida et al., 2004). Understanding
   the evolution of ecologically relevant traits, under different biotic
   and abiotic contexts, may improve the stability and efficiency of
   biofuel production.

   The application of evolutionary theory to algal biofuel production is
   in its infancy, but holds immense potential. Algal populations are
   large and have short generation times. Usually the populations maintain
   high phenotypic and genetic diversity (Brandenburg et al., 2018; Chen
   and Rynearson, 2016; Lebret et al., 2012; Masseret et al., 2009;
   Rynearson and Armbrust, 2000). Evolution in such populations can be
   fast if selection is strong (Thibodeau et al., 2015; Takehito Yoshida
   et al., 2003). Harnessing the adaptive evolutionary potential of algal
   populations could help us explore the range of feasible trait space to
   obtain desirable trait combinations. For example, researchers are
--
   population growth rates. Such trait combinations are normally mutually
   exclusive. Approaches include genetic engineering (Zeng et al., 2011),
   directed evolution via successive rounds of mutagenesis and selection
   (Johnson et al., 2016; Lewin et al., 2016), and selection on the
   existing levels of genetic variation in a population (Mooij et al.,
   2013; Shurin et al., 2016).

   While evolution might help us improve biofuel production (Kazamia et
   al., 2014), it might also culminate in undesirable outcomes. For
   example, engineering solutions based on evolutionary trade-offs might
   be eroded over time due to mutation, horizontal gene transfer, and
   recombination. Custom designed biofuel production systems should also
   consider the evolutionary consequences of rapid harvesting. For
   example, rare beneficial mutations arising during population expansion,
   might be periodically lost before they sweep to dominance in the
   populations (Bull and Collins, 2012; Shurin et al., 2016). In short,
   evolution offers both promises and pitfalls for biofuel production.

2.3. Chemical pollutants: when evolution is, and is not, the solution to
pollution

--
   Because pollution and the ecological context in which pollution occurs
   is often highly local, we can expect pollution to have many different
   evolutionary consequences in natural ecosystems. However, the
   biological effects of pollutants are typically studied using a limited
   number of model species and strains, usually in oversimplified
--
   organisms (Relyea and Hoverman, 2006). Synthetic chemicals present a
   particular challenge because the exposed organisms may lack the
   exposure history necessary for the emergence of an evolutionary
   adaptation. Synthetic chemicals can also act as mutagens that disrupt
   the homeostasis of organisms (Bickham et al., 2000).
--
   that their persistence over time becomes threatened (Williams and
   Oleksiak, 2008). Interestingly many classic studies about rapid
   evolution involve chemical pollution, such as the evolution of
   resistance to pesticides, resistance to antibiotics or mining-related
   metal pollution (Hoffmann and Parsons, 1997; Palumbi, 2009) and, more
   recently, pollutant induced elevated mutation rates and rapid
   adaptation (Brady et al., 2017; Coutellec and Barata, 2013; Kimberly
   and Salice, 2012; Loria et al., 2019; Palumbi, 2009). Evolutionary
   adaptation to chemical pollution can also rescue populations from
   extinction caused by demographic decline. For example, experimental
--
   genetic adaptations (Oziolor et al., 2017; Reid et al., 2016).
   Unsurprisingly, adaptation of a population can also be an unwanted
   outcome of management, such as when the evolution of resistance reduces
   the sensitivity of a species used in ecological risk assessment (Morgan
   et al., 2007). Evolution's ability to alter the direction of responses
   to environmental change, such as that brought by chemical pollution, is
   one of the main arguments for including evolutionary concepts in
   environmental research. Finally, potential for evolutionarily based
   solutions to pollution comes from implementing bioremediation, such as
   designing microbial communities that have evolved the ability of
   biodegradation of chemicals (Liu and Suflita, 1993).

2.4. Algal blooms: when evolution muddies the waters

   Harmful algal blooms are often associated with eutrophication,
--
   input releases phytoplankton from control by grazers (Abrams and
   Walters, 1996; Gragnani et al., 1999; Pančić and Kiørboe, 2018).
   Additionally, evolutionary processes are also relevant to the
   emergence, volume and toxicity of blooms. Indeed, we postulate that
   trying to manage harmful blooms without Darwin, is like trying to fly
   to the moon without Newton (modifying Andrew Read's concluding remark
   on his TEDMED talk on importance of evolutionary medicine:
   https://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=7286).

   The trade-off between resource uptake and grazing resistance is at the
   root of the ecological and evolutionary causes of bloom biomass
   (Cloern, 2018). Selective grazing by zooplankton will deplete edible
   algae and, subsequently, increase the abundance of well-defended algae
--
   varies widely both within and among populations. For example, some
   lineages entirely lack the genes for toxin production (Brandenburg et
   al., 2018; Briand et al., 2009). The evolutionary dynamics of different
   toxic/non-toxic genotypes during algal blooms is likely driven by
   physiological trade-offs between costs of toxin production and resource
--
   et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012), but the selective factors that favor
   toxic variants in bloom forming algae are not fully understood.
   Identifying the evolutionary processes involved in algal blooms would
   likely help us predict which algal blooms might turn toxic. In a first
   step, reliable prediction would enable the avoidance of risks
--
3. Evolving the environmental sciences

   Evolutionary processes are often an inescapable and critical component
   of both understanding and solving environmental problems. The evolution
   of resistance genes will continually challenge our efforts to halt
   diseases through the development of new drugs, highlighting the need to
   complement efforts in drug discovery with the development of
   evolution-aware application strategies. A better appreciation of
   evolution's limits and, in particular, the impossibility of Darwinian
   demons, is critical to meeting our energy demands by matching algal
   genotypes with optimal environmental conditions for biofuel production.
--
   conservative option when assessing ecological risk to chemical
   pollutants. Engineering solutions in waste-water treatment plants might
   be improved if we could harness evolution's power to help biodegrade
   persistent compounds (Brenner et al., 2008). Other environmental
   problems with limited engineering-oriented solutions could be tackled
   with evolutionary perspectives. For example, biocides may be applied to
   combat algal blooms, but it is notoriously difficult to predict the
   timing, duration and toxicity of algal blooms. A better understanding
   of the evolutionary dynamics of such systems, gained, for example, by
   tracking environmental change in real-time and linking those changes
   with environmental sources of natural selection, could help us predict
--
   also sensitive to anthropogenic impacts. Predictions about complex
   ecological systems are challenging and require solid understanding of
   ecological and evolutionary mechanisms behind population growth,
   genetic and trait diversity, trait-environmental relationships,
   trade-offs, and community dynamics. Such principles are present in the
--

   It is possible that prevailing misconceptions about the pace and
   prevalence of evolution may be blocking the integration of evolution
   into the environmental sciences. First, the pace of evolutionary
   adaptation is not only set by the rate of mutations and the subsequent
   rate of increase of novel alleles in the population. Instead, the rate
   of adaptation, i.e. the increase in mean population fitness over time,
   is directly proportional to the genetic variance in a population that
   can respond to natural selection (Fisher, 1930). Evolution from
   existing levels of heritable trait variation in a population can be
   much quicker and more predictable than expected based on evolution
   driven via new variants in the population that arise solely by
   mutation. Second, evolution is neither rare nor a special case. The
   challenge for environmental science is to determine the relative
   importance of evolution, either for causing or for ameliorating a
   particular environmental problem.

   Overall, we argue that evolutionary principles are a useful resource
   for coming up with solutions to environmental problems. On the one
   hand, seemingly rational solutions might require some ‘evolution
   proofing’ to effectively anticipate and limit any potential negative
   impacts of evolution on the expected outcomes of our interventions. On
   the other hand, evolution itself can be a powerful design strategy for
   solving environmental problems. Design by directed evolution, for
   example, has made considerable progress developing novel enzymes
   (Arnold, 1998), and configuring communities to perform specific
--
   way forward is to relinquish our engineering hubris in favor of a
   problem solving strategy that is either informed by, or directed by,
   evolution. Environmental science has a rich history of
   interdisciplinarity. A stronger integration with evolutionary biology
   would improve our ability to address global societal challenges in
   general (Carroll et al., 2014), and environmental challenges in
