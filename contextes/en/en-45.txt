Abstract

   Cultural evolution theory has long been inspired by evolutionary
   biology. Conceptual analogies between biological and cultural evolution
   have led to the adoption of a range of formal theoretical approaches
   from population dynamics and genetics. However, this has resulted in a
   research programme with a strong focus on cultural transmission. Here,
   we contrast biological with cultural evolution, and highlight aspects
   of cultural evolution that have not received sufficient attention
   previously. We outline possible implications for evolutionary dynamics
   and argue that not taking them into account will limit our
   understanding of cultural systems. We propose 12 key questions for

   certain cultural practices, there has been a centuries-long effort to
   devise or formulate a general theory of culture. One such approach is
   the application of evolutionary theory to culture. Inspired by Darwin’s
   publication ‘On the Origin of Species’ [4], the idea of taking an
   evolutionary perspective on (human) culture has received considerable
   research interest from scholars in many fields. The popularity of using
   evolutionary terminology when describing cultural change, however, has
   varied considerably over time (for overviews of evolutionary thinking
   in the humanities and social sciences, see [5–10]). This was in part
   due to a lack of understanding of biological evolution but also based
   on the politically motivated misuse of evolutionary theory (see [11]).

   A more recent approach to studying cultural evolution was inspired by
   the quantitative theories that emerged in the life sciences in the
   first half of the twentieth century. They were the direct result of
   major advances in the understanding of the evolutionary process, marked
   by the Modern Synthesis that unified Darwinian evolution with Mendelian
   genetics. These novel formal descriptions of biological transmission
   greatly increased the understanding of biological evolution. The
   theoretical models by Fisher [12], Wright [13] and Haldane [14] cast
   verbal theories and thought experiments in the precise language of
   mathematics, which allowed a systematic analysis of the processes
   involved in and the consequences for biological evolution. Moreover,
   using formal theoretical models has proven useful for extracting the
   most important features from complex processes, by keeping track of
--
   populations of individuals, be it genetic or cultural traits. To
   justify this approach, the authors assumed and outlined structural and
   conceptual analogies between biological and cultural evolution. At an
   abstract level, population-level processes in both domains are
   characterized by the continuous emergence, selective retention, and
   transmission of variation [18–21]. Hence, analogies have been made
   between the forces driving the evolution of genetic traits
   (transmission, mutation, drift and selection) and those driving the
   evolution of cultural traits (transmission, innovation, random
   fluctuations and selection). Additionally, both types are characterized
   by observable phenomena (e.g. an adapted species and cumulative
   culture) that are high-level properties (of a species and a population,
   respectively), which are the result of low-level interactions (at the
   level of individuals). Finally, both biological and cultural evolution
   are cumulative processes. That is, traits evolve successively through
   repeatedly modifying, combining, re-combining and re-purposing existing
--

   In contrast to the aforementioned general similarities, there are
   obvious differences between cultural and biological evolution that
   require mathematical approaches to be adapted [27]. For example, if
   parents exhibit different variants of a cultural trait (e.g. hunting
--

   In fact, this space is so rich that the overwhelming amount of cultural
   evolution research has primarily focused on cultural transmission. What
   the aforementioned seminal books started has become a rich and vibrant
   research field that has garnered much interest from researchers across
--

   Precisely because of this surge of interest, we believe it is an ideal
   moment to identify potential avenues for future cultural evolution
   research. We believe that there are a number of differences between
   biological and cultural evolution that have still not received
   sufficient attention. We identify specific differences by contrasting
   characteristics of biological and cultural evolution and point out some
   (table 1) that are of special interest. Our analysis mainly focuses on
   unique features of the acquisition, storage, recall and transmission,

   differ from those associated with genetically inherited traits. We then
   discuss the consequences of these differences and potential
   implications for our understanding of cultural evolution. Our main aim
   is to contribute to opening up new lines of investigation, novel
   insights, and testable hypotheses.

2.  Differences between biological and cultural evolution

   In this section, we summarize several important differences between
   biological and cultural evolution, before we discuss implications for
   theories of cultural evolution in the following section. Table 1 is an
   attempt to identify core differences by contrasting various aspects of
   biological and cultural evolution. Some of the listed differences have
   been considered previously [11,15,17,27,34] while others have received
   less attention. We argue that recognizing these differences will affect
   the understanding of cultural evolution in general, and modelling
   approaches in particular, as it is well known that even small changes
   to the mechanisms of dynamical systems can fundamentally change their
--

   It is important to note that (human) cognitive abilities, many unique,
   are a factor in many of the items listed under cultural evolution in
   the table and thus have consequences for the dynamics and outcome of
   cultural evolution. For instance, opportunities for cultural
   recombination and thus generation of new culture is significantly
   enhanced by human thinking, planning and problem-solving abilities.
--
   cultural artefacts and externalized information storage (see §2a). One
   aspect that is not included in the table is processing. While it is
   undoubtedly integral to both biological and cultural evolution, some
   sort of processing is occurring in all items of the table.

--

   The way in which information is stored differs fundamentally between
   cultural and biological evolution. In biological evolution, information
   (genetic traits) is encoded in and stored as the sequence of physical
   molecular structures, the genome. By contrast, in cultural evolution,
   cultural information within individuals (cultural traits) takes the
   form of mental representations, which are encoded as neuronal
--
   flexibility of the nervous system, mental representations can be
   continuously altered before they are exhibited and transmitted to
   others. These differences have consequences for the evolutionary
   dynamics and concerns several of the other items in the table, which we
   will address in §3.
--
   information storage, computation and filtering (and in part creation),
   an increasingly important question is how information technology
   changes cultural evolution as well as our mental abilities (e.g. [29]).

(b) Acquisition

   Based on the difference in the nature of trait storage in cultural and
   biological evolution, the acquisition of traits is also fundamentally
   different. Genetic traits are in place at the beginning of an
   individual’s life, whereas cultural traits are acquired throughout the
--
   social learning to acquire the fundamental behaviours and techniques
   but they also rely on lifelong improvement through individual learning
   [50]. This difference between cultural and biological evolution has
   received rather limited attention, but it may be one of the most
   important ones influencing evolutionary dynamics [51,52]. As we will
   discuss below, the fact that humans are born without culture and
   acquire culture sequentially, making the individual an active force in
   the transmission, has several consequences for the dynamics of cultural
   evolution, including, for instance, the fact that previously acquired
   traits can facilitate or even preclude the subsequent acquisition of
   other traits, and that an individual may transmit different trait
--
   alterations to the environment), such that the observer can form its
   own mental representation of a cultural trait. This difference between
   cultural and biological evolution is widely recognized [15,17,24] and
   consistent with general findings in developmental psychology and
   educational science (e.g. [48,49]). Nevertheless, the concrete
   transmission process and its consequences for the evolutionary dynamics
   are not fully understood and are subject to an ongoing debate (see
   §3b). At its centre is the role of the relative fidelity of
--
   Given that mental representations of cultural traits are transmitted
   through observation and recreation, there is no fixed transmission
   direction. Compared to biological evolution, where genes are
   transmitted from parents to offspring, transmission in cultural
   evolution can occur between any individuals. The diversity of possible
   transmission pathways, which in themselves are subject to cultural
   evolution, leads to interesting complex patterns [62].

(iii) Receiver dependence

   Another interesting and increasingly recognized difference of
   transmission in biological and cultural evolution is that genetic
   traits are supplied all at once, without the participation of the new
   individual. By contrast, in the transmission of cultural traits, not
   only the sender (teacher, model or demonstrator) but also the receiver
   (student or observer) can actively affect the transmission dynamics and
   thus evolutionary dynamics [16,17]. For instance, the observer may be
   selective about what and from whom to learn [16,17,63]. Such biases or
   social learning strategies [64,65] may be inborn [16,17] or stem from
--

   Sorting processes are processes that lead to a non-random change in the
   frequency of traits. In biological evolution, the main sorting process
   is natural selection. How it operates is usually clear and well
   understood, and it brings a general understanding of biological
   adaptations. In cultural evolution, the situation is considerably more
   complex, which is in part due to the active role each individual takes
   in acquiring, exhibiting and transmitting cultural traits [17]. The
--
   control by, for instance, trying to influence what others do, or
   communicate by selectively punishing or rewarding such acts [68–70]. In
   addition, there is natural selection in cultural evolution, since
   cultural traits can influence survival and reproduction of their
   carriers and so affect trait frequencies [15,17]. For instance, a habit
--

   In summary, sorting is possibly the most complex part of the
   evolutionary dynamics of cultural evolution, as it involves a number of
   different processes, and several of these occur in combination with
   other key processes such as transmission and generation of new culture.
--

   The continuous generation of variation is a central aspect of
   evolution. A generally recognized difference between biological and
   cultural evolution is that genetic variation is random and unrelated to
   any need or purpose. By contrast, in cultural evolution the generation
   of new variants can also be incentive-driven. This means that it is
   directed towards solving a concrete problem or reaching a certain goal.
--
   used.

3.  Implications and challenges for cultural evolution theory

   The differences that we discussed in the previous section can have
   dramatic effects on the evolutionary dynamics. In this part, we will
   discuss a selection of these that we think are particularly important
   to the further development of cultural evolution theory.

(a) Potential for fast evolution and complex culture

   Cultural evolution can proceed much faster than biological evolution,
   both in rate of change and in terms of trait complexity. This has been
   pointed out previously, and several reasons are generally given for why
--
   throughout an individual’s entire lifetime. Secondly, novel or modified
   traits can be transmitted directly to other individuals (which is why
   cultural evolution is sometimes described as Lamarckian rather than
   Darwinian). Thirdly, the generation of novel variants can be
   incentive-driven. This may have a dramatic effect on the rate of
   evolution, since cultural traits will be much more likely to be
   productive once they ‘enter’ the real world. And, finally, language can
   be an important tool for efficient cultural transmission. It is
--
   mental skills.

   A full understanding of evolutionary rates and complex culture also
   requires a detailed understanding of cumulative cultural evolution.
   Cumulative culture is not only the accumulation of traits but also the
   innovation of new traits by combining or recombining existing traits
--
   theory of how cultural complexity and cultural systems emerge (see
   §3d). Also, it could explain, through the power of combinatorics, how
   cultural evolution can generate a never-ending stream of new variation.

   For a better understanding of the role of language and recombination in
   cumulative cultural evolution, future research needs to address several
   important questions, such as:
     * i.
       What are the combinatorial properties that allow a seemingly
       unbounded generation of diversity and complexity in human
       cumulative cultural evolution?
     * ii.
       What is the role of language, symbolism, and cognitive abilities in
       cumulative cultural evolution?
     * iii.
       Can all types of cultural change be understood in evolutionary
       terms (listed in table 1), or do we need additional theoretical
       frameworks?
--

   Development here refers broadly to the processes that shape and modify
   the individual during its lifetime. In biological evolution,
   development is usually separated from the processes that transmit
   genetic traits and its evolution is studied in life-history theory,
   which emphasizes the role of trade-offs [81]. By contrast, in cultural
   evolution, development and transmission processes tend to be more
   intertwined, as they occur on the same time scale. On the one hand, an
   individual’s experience is shaped by sequential encounters with its
--
   psychology, educational science and linguistics [48,49]. Several
   general findings from empirical research in these fields are relevant
   to cultural evolution. First and foremost, development is generally
   incremental and time-consuming, starting with learning simple features
   and elements that are later integrated into a functional practical or
--
   individuals. The situation is complicated by findings showing that
   learning and memory abilities themselves respond to training, and are
   thus partly cultural and subject to cultural evolution [48,89,90].

   Previous theoretical models of cultural evolution typically use
   simplified assumptions about individual development and rely on simple
   copying mechanisms and strategies for social learning [91–94], or treat
   social and individual learning as opposing alternatives [17,95], whose
   evolution is generally studied in the absence of a
   learning–reproduction trade-off (see [96] for how classical results are
   critically changed once the learning–reproduction trade-off is taken
--
   of simpler traits or because they require individual improvement).
   These models should further be embedded into a proper life-history
   context so as to make all traits pertaining to learning co-evolutionary
   [97].

--
     * i.
       How can developmental psychology and related fields inform cultural
       evolution research? For example, in the debate between the
       ‘California’ and the ‘Paris’ school on why cultural learning can be
       faithful to its source and maintained over generations, while
--
       feedback loops.
     * ii.
       What is the scope of cultural evolution in terms of mental
       abilities? To what extent are mental abilities and psychological
       mechanisms learnt from or influenced by the cultural environment
       [100,101], and thus subject to cultural evolution themselves [30]?
       Future models that combine developmental processes and cultural
       evolution may help to distinguish the roles of inborn factors,
       acquired traits and individual experience.
     * iii.
--
       co-evolved with life history?

(c) Different evolutionary outcomes and cultural fitness

   In biological evolution, the fate of a trait can be understood by
   considering the average reproductive success of all carriers of that
   trait [102,103]. It is common to use optimization and game theoretic
   approaches to study evolutionary endpoints (i.e. adaptations). By
   contrast, in cultural evolution there is no generally accepted
   formulation of cultural fitness [104] as the relationship between the
   individual and its traits is more complicated. Here, transmission is
--
   individuals, and the individual is not fixed with respect to the
   cultural traits it possesses and exhibits to others during its life.
   These differences have implications both for the outcome of evolution
   and for how cultural evolution should be theoretically explored
   [11,15,17,52]. In principle, anything that influences transmission,
   retention and use of cultural traits needs to be considered.

   preferences for lifestyles [108].

   In any human society, we find a range of both material and non-material
--

   It is quite possible that concepts like adaptation and fitness in
   cultural evolution will not have equivalent and as straightforward
   meanings as they do in biological evolution. The complication is that
   individuals are subject to change during their lives, which can be
   illustrated by comparing a trait that transmits rather slowly to
--
   on just the traits or free-floating memes [104]. While this can be a
   useful approach for certain questions, a general theory of cultural
   evolution cannot ignore the individual because of its active roll in
   acquiring, processing and exhibiting cultural traits [104]. This is one
   of the reasons that make it so tricky to find a useful concept of units
   of evolution in cultural evolution (a unit might be the single cultural
   trait or a set of traits, but also the carrier of a trait, etc.).

       Is it possible to provide a general theoretical account for the
       observed diversity of outcomes of human cultural evolution?
     * ii.
       How can we define and recognize cultural adaptations, at what level
       are they manifested, and how can we use them to identify useful
       units of cultural evolution?
     * iii.
       What could be a useful concept of fitness in cultural evolution,
       and, if it exists, how can it be used to study cultural evolution?

(d) Trait interactions, cultural systems and evolving evolutionary dynamics

   The facts that individuals acquire traits sequentially and that traits
   can interact may have important organizing effects. The resulting
   developmental path dependence (see §3b) can limit which traits an
   individual acquires, and so promote the evolution of cultural systems
   [22,55,66,111,112]. For instance, an individual might acquire a belief
   A about the world, which subsequently facilitates the acquisition of
--
   acquisition of an entirely different belief system. Similar reasoning
   can apply to other categories of traits. In fact, there are many ways
   in which traits can interact and influence evolution. Traits may or may
   not operate well together (within or between individuals), they might
   express preferences towards other traits, and define goals the
--

   Trait interactions could also have even more pronounced effects, and
   bring about changes to the evolutionary process itself, that is,
   important aspects of cultural evolution dynamics may themselves be
   results of cultural evolution rather than determined by genetic factors
   or external circumstances [22,114,115]. Examples of such changes in
   biological evolution are migration, mutation and sexual reproduction,
   which are called modifier traits. These traits have important
   consequences for the dynamics of biological evolution, but they are
   also products of that same evolution, thus resulting in
   counterintuitive feedbacks [116]. All items in table 1 are potentially
   subject to cultural evolution, and it has been suggested that cultural
   evolution itself can influence social learning abilities [1], efforts
   by senders’ and receivers’ willingness to change [114,117], and
   transmission pathways [62]. Culturally established goals could have a
   dramatic effect on the outcome of cultural evolution. Acerbi et al.
   [114] introduced the term regulatory traits for cultural traits that
   influence the dynamics of the evolutionary process and suggested that
   their evolution depends on their ability to directly or indirectly
   influence their own evolution.

   The organizing effects of interactions and feedbacks can also be seen
   in the broader perspective of evolutionary transitions. These are
   fundamental modifications to the evolutionary process, caused by
   evolution itself. Maynard Smith & Szathmáry [21] recognized several
   properties common to such transitions, which we can also find in human
   cultural evolution. The first property is that new ways of transmitting
   information are formed. Humans have invented a series of information
   technologies, like reading and writing, radio and television, databases

4.  Concluding remarks

   Studying cultural evolution in an evolutionary framework has come a
   long way. The development of this research programme has proven
   invaluable to our understanding of many cultural phenomena. The many
   differences between cultural and biological evolution, while not
   invalidating an evolutionary approach, show that there is a rich
   research field with many potentially interesting avenues for future
   studies. The way mental representations are stored, recalled,
--

   We hope that the collection of ideas we have presented here have
   highlighted some of the complexity of cultural evolution, which occurs
   at different organizational levels, along different timelines, between
   the material and the immaterial, and the biotic and abiotic world.
   Clearly, a full understanding of culture requires interdisciplinary
   efforts. Fortunately, cultural evolution research has always been at
   home in a variety of disciplines. And on closer inspection, much work
   has been evolutionary at its core, even if the term was not explicitly
   used.

   Acknowledgements) have emphasized the value of overcoming semantic
   barriers that exist across disciplines. Despite different historical
   motivations, perspectives and approaches to cultural evolution
   research, there are shared ambitions and overlapping questions. We
   would like to close this essay with three suggestions to strengthen the
--
   segregation, social immobility, systems of belief, cooperation, trust
   and polarization. There has been a tendency to focus on general
   questions in cultural evolution modelling, such as the emergence,
   change, transmission and accumulation of cultural traits. By
   considering more specific phenomena, it should also be possible to
   generate new concrete and testable hypotheses. Perhaps one of the best
   examples of a productive interaction between cultural evolutionary
   theorising and empirical research, blending general and specific
   theories with in-depth knowledge about the phenomena, can be found in
   recent developments in language evolution [121].

   Acknowledging existing work in other fields. We also think that it is
--
   the humanities and the social sciences, and also to make use of the
   wealth of existing empirical data on human culture. There are two
   aspects to this. One is that evolutionary thinking is not a novel
   concept in the humanities and social sciences, as we discussed above.
   The other is that many theories, including verbal, statistical and
   mathematical models, are genuinely evolutionary in our sense, without
   using the term evolution. Thus there are clear overlapping goals with
   cultural evolutionary research. This applies to both older verbal
   hypotheses and recent theoretical work. A few examples of the latter
   include: studies on social learning dynamics in evolutionary game
   theory in economics [122,123]; the dynamics of knowledge production and
   acquisition at the aggregate (population) level studied in
   macroeconomics [124–127]; and models of beliefs of agents studied in
   sociology [128,129]. Microeconomics has also adopted the cultural
   evolution framework, as introduced by Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, and
   applies it to all sorts of questions [130,131]. An important next step
   in acknowledging existing research must be synthetic work. It has

   Connecting disciplines. Finally, we suggest making use of knowledge
   from and cooperation with a few fields that are rarely mentioned in
   formal theoretical studies of cultural evolution. Two such fields that
   we have mentioned throughout this paper are developmental psychology
   and educational science. Together these fields have gathered important
--
   scenarios described, and the interaction with individual learning,
   differ from assumptions and strategic thinking about social learning
   common in cultural evolution research. They also offer insight into
   nature–nurture issues, the scope of cultural evolution, and how mental
   abilities can be transmitted. Another field of potential interest is
   artificial intelligence and related fields in cognitive science, which
