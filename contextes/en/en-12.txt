word story For evolution

   Evolution comes from Latin ēvolūtiō (stem ēvolūtiōn- ) “unrolling a
   papyrus scroll, reading through (an author's words or a book),” a
   derivative of the verb ēvolvere “to roll out or away, unroll (a papyrus
   scroll), uncover, unwrap, unfold by using the intellect.”
   The earliest English meaning of evolution, “a movement or series of
   movements of troops or ships into battle formation,” dates from the
   early 17th century. The modern, biological sense “change in the gene

   Charles Darwin did not use the word evolution at all in his first
   edition of On the Origin of Species (1859), although he did use the
   verb evolved at the very end of the book. Darwin preferred descent with
   modification, because the idea of progress had no place in his theory
   or work. It was his contemporary Herbert Spencer who, embracing
   Darwin's work, popularized evolution in its biological sense and also
   extended the word into ethics, philosophy, and sociology.

Scientific definitions for evolution

   evolution

   [ ĕv′ə-lōō′shən ]
--
       explain the origin of the variation of the traits between
       individual organisms and the way in which they are passed from
       generation to generation. This basic model of evolution has since
       been further refined, and the role of genetic drift and sexual
       selection in the evolution of populations has been recognized. See
       also natural selection sexual selection. See Notes at adaptation

a closer look

   Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection assumed that tiny
   adaptations occur in organisms constantly over millions of years.
   Gradually, a new species develops that is distinct from its ancestors.
   In the 1970s, however, biologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould
   proposed that evolution by natural selection may not have been such a
   smooth and consistent process. Based on fossils from around the world
   that showed the abrupt appearance of new species, Eldredge and Gould
   suggested that evolution is better described through punctuated
   equilibrium. That is, for long periods of time species remain virtually
   unchanged, not even gradually adapting. They are in equilibrium, in

Cultural definitions for evolution

   evolution
     __________________________________________________________________

--
   according to which the Earth's species have changed and diversified
   through time under the influence of natural selection. Life on Earth is
   thought to have evolved in three stages. First came chemical evolution,
   in which organic molecules (see also organic molecule) were formed.
   This was followed by the development of single cells capable of
   reproducing themselves. This stage led to the development of complex
   organisms capable of sexual reproduction. Evolution is generally
   accepted as fact by scientists today, although debates continue over
   the precise mechanisms involved in the process. (See mutation,
   punctuated equilibrium, and creation science.)
