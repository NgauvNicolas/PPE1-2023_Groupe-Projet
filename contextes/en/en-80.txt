   organisms to their environment in order to improve their chances at
   survival in that environment.

   In evolutionary theory, adaptation is the biological mechanism by which
   organisms adjust to new environments or to changes in their current
   environment. Although scientists discussed adaptation prior to the

   Wallace developed the theory of natural selection.

   Wallace believed that the evolution of organisms was connected in some
   way with adaptation of organisms to changing environmental conditions.
   In developing the theory of evolution by natural selection, Wallace and
   Darwin both went beyond simple adaptation by explaining how organisms
   adapt and evolve. The idea of natural selection is that traits that can

   other organisms of the same species. This enables better survival and
   reproduction compared with other members of the species, leading to
   evolution.

   Organisms can adapt to an environment in different ways. They can adapt

   Scientists who studied adaptation prior to the development of
   evolutionary theory included Georges Louis Leclerc Comte de Buffon. He
   was a French mathematician who believed that organisms changed over
   time by adapting to the environments of their geographical locations.

   giraffes that had long enough necks to feed themselves survived long
   enough to reproduce. Natural selection, then, provides a more
   compelling mechanism for adaptation and evolution than Lamarck's
   theories.
