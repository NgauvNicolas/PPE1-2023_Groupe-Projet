How could evolution arise from conscious agents?

   Donald Hoffman claims to have used the theory of evolution by natural
   selection to discover that what we perceive isnâ€™t objective reality,
   but an interface with it (3 August, p 34). He says evolution itself may
   be just an interface projection of deeper dynamics stemming from a
   network of conscious agents. But such agents arrive late in the fossil
   record, so how could evolution arise before they existed?
