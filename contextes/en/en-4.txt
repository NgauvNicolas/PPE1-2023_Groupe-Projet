An introduction to evolution

The definition

   Biological evolution, simply put, is descent with inherited
   modification. This definition encompasses everything from small-scale
   evolution (for example, changes in the frequency of different gene
   versions in a population from one generation to the next) to
   large-scale evolution (for example, the descent of different species
   from a shared ancestor over many generations). Evolution helps us to
   understand the living world around us, as well as its history.

The explanation

   Biological evolution is not simply a matter of change over time. Many
   things change over time: caterpillars turn into moths, trees lose and
   regrow their leaves, mountain ranges rise and erode, but they aren’t
   examples of biological evolution because they don’t involve descent
   with inherited modifications.

   modification, this common ancestor gave rise to the diverse species
   that we see documented in the fossil record and around us today.
   Evolution means that we’re all distant cousins: humans and oak trees,
   hummingbirds and whales.
