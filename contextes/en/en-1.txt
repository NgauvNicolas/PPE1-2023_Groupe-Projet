12,000 years of landscape evolution in the southern White Mountains, New
Hampshire, as recorded in Ossipee Lake sediments

--
   Continuous records of sediment yield spanning from the late glacial
   through the Holocene to the present day provide an important
   opportunity to investigate landscape evolution over various timescales
   in response to a variety of natural and anthropogenic forcing
   mechanisms. This study investigates variations in sediment yield and
   landscape evolution in the 768 km2 watershed of Ossipee Lake, New
   Hampshire, USA. We pair subbottom sonar observations with analyses of
   lacustrine sediment cores to interpret a 12,000+ yr record of lake
   sedimentation in terms of changes in sediment yield and landscape
   evolution. Our results indicate high rates of sediment redistribution
   following deglaciation at ~14,500 to ~12,000 cal yr BP, followed by a
   period of gradually decreasing sediment yield until ~9000 cal yr BP,

Late-glacial landscape evolution

   regional forest cover, which would have helped stabilize hillslopes,
   strengthen stream banks, and promote a transition from braided to

   MAR[clastic] curve during this interval is consistent with an
   exhaustion model of paraglacial landscape evolution (Ballantyne,
   Reference Ballantyne2002), in which the supply of easily mobilized
   sediment decreases as the landscape stabilizes. However, lacking the
   detailed age control within this interval needed to adequately
   constrain short-duration variations in sediment yield, we cannot rule
   out an evolution dominated by waves of erosion, as suggested by Church
   and Ryder (Reference Church and Ryder1972). Notably, the variable
