   Biological evolution is the supposed process by which the first cell
   evolved into the diversity of life we see today. Natural selection and
   mutations are considered its driving force; however, evolution has
   never been observed despite numerous protestations to the contrary.
   Natural selection and mutations cannot add the information necessary to
   change one kind of organism into another. And it doesn’t take a science
   degree to understand why molecules-to-man evolution is impossible.

Evolution Defined: “Macro vs. Micro” Evolution

   Evolution is a word that is used a lot but is poorly defined.
   Evolutionists themselves frequently equivocate on the term, using it to
   mean multiple things, sometimes even within the same sentence.

   “Macroevolution” is used to describe the large-scale changes believed
   to be able to turn a blob of protoplasm into a person. By contrast,
   “microevolution” is intended to describe the small-scale changes in
   populations, such as those exhibited by Darwin’s finches—the finch
   populations change beak sizes regularly in response to environmental

   take place.

   Since the term evolution is so strongly associated with the
   particles-to-people myth, we tend to use the word speciation to explain
   adaptation and variation within the created kinds, such as that
   exhibited by the finches.Because the small-scale changes generally lead
   to a loss of genetic information rather than a gain of new information
   needed to create new traits like arms and eyes, microevolution can
   never lead to macroevolution. Evolutionists tend to use these ideas
   interchangeably. For this reason, we avoid those terms, preferring to
   speak of speciation within created kinds (which we can observe and
   verify) and molecules-to-man evolution (which is unobservable and
   unverifiable).
   History Of Evolution

History of Evolution: Charles Darwin and Others

   Many people believe that evolution began with Charles Darwin in 1859.
   This belief, however, is inaccurate. Evolution as an idea has existed
   since at least the Greek philosophers. A Frenchman named Jean-Baptiste
   Lamarck had proposed a form of evolution in the early 1800s. In fact,
   Darwin’s grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, engraved a Latin motto on his
   coach and book plates meaning “Everything from Shells,” indicating his
   belief in evolution.

   Darwin built on past ideas and added his own wrinkle, one he borrowed
--
   to add millions of years into the Bible. The influence of Chalmers and
   others like him caused many in the church to unquestioningly accept
   millions of years and some to even add Darwin’s evolutionary ideas into
   the Bible.

Evolutionary Thought Since Darwin

   Since Darwin’s time, evolution has become the dominant dogma in the
   sciences, even in seemingly unrelated areas. It is impossible to go to
   a secular school and not get overdosed with evolutionary teaching. The
   base model of the dogma has changed very little since Darwin.

   Evolutionists still teach that man evolved from apelike creatures over
   millions of years. Other aspects of the idea have been filled in so
   that the evolutionary skeleton looks a little more complete, at least
   for public consumption. However, digging beneath the surface reveals
   things are not well in the evolutionary dogma.

   Evolution became permanently immortalized in American culture in 1925
   in what was termed the “Scopes Monkey Trial” in Tennessee. Attempting
   to challenge a Tennessee state law that forbade teaching human
   evolution, the ACLU prompted a substitute teacher named John Scopes to
   admit to breaking the law, even though he later acknowledged he had
   never done so. The trial took on monumental proportions when two of the

   Genetic Challenge

The Genetic Challenge to Classic Darwinian Evolution

   Darwin had no knowledge of genetics, even though Mendel’s
   groundbreaking work on genetics was published during his lifetime. When
   genetics made its way into mainstream science, evolutionists adapted
   Darwin’s ideas to fit the emerging study of genetics, forming what is
   called the Modern Synthesis of Darwinian evolution, or neo-Darwinism.
   Most evolutionists today are adherents of neo-Darwinism to one extent
   or another. Neo-Darwinism emphasizes four major forces: gene flow,
   genetic drift, natural selection, and mutations. From these four

   Natural selection is the primary mover in the evolutionary dogma.
   Natural selection allows organisms that are best suited to their
   environment to survive and pass on their genetics with greater

   in.

   Evolutionists regard mutations as the force that creates new variation.
   While they acknowledge that mutations almost always remove genetic
   potential, they believe that on rare occasions a mutation will occur
--
How Mutations Work in Real Life

   But the observable facts do not fit evolutionists’ dogma. Natural
   selection does happen, but it works just as Blyth envisioned it did: as
   a preservative, weeding out the worst mutations to preserve the health
   of a population. Scientists acknowledge natural selection is not the
   same as evolution. Mutations likewise occur, but most if not all
   mutations described as beneficial are only beneficial in certain, often
   unusual, situations.

   Antibiotic resistant bacteria is an often-cited example of evolution in
   action by means of mutation and natural selection. Antibiotic
   resistance already existed in bacterial populations before they were

   Information requires an intelligent source, since it requires not only
   data but also the ability to decode that data. This alone is enough to
   refute evolution because there’s no way for a fish to become an
   amphibian without new information.
   Origin of Life

The Origin of Life in Darwinian Evolution

   Any ideas about how life could have started on earth overlook one
--
   While Darwin himself never addressed the origin of the universe and
   rarely touched on the origin of life, both are key aspects of
   evolutionary dogma. While many evolutionists attempt to distance
   themselves from these, particularly the origin-of-life question, both
   are fundamentally necessary for evolution to be true. Since most
   evolutionists insist on a naturalistic explanation for everything, the
   origin of life and origin of the universe are both fundamental
   questions evolutionists must answer to support their dogma and a
   naturalistic worldview.

   The origin-of-life question has troubled evolutionists for decades. In
   Darwin’s day, the internal workings of the cell were completely
   unknown. It was easy to speculate about the origin of something

   structures needed for life.

The Fossil-Record Problem for Evolution

   The fossil record is regularly trotted out as containing the finest
   examples of evolutionary changes in organisms. Yet within the
   evolutionist community itself, there was a massive schism in the 1970s
   when the late Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge proposed the idea of
   punctuated equilibrium. This idea acknowledged a virtual absence of
   transitional forms in the fossil record and proposed that evolution was
   not a gradual process. Instead, it was a jerky, jumpy process that
   mostly involved stasis before great leaps of change. While less common
--
   forms in the fossil record.

   Evolutionists prop up their dogma by claiming the earth is millions or
   even billions of years old. The most common proof of these great ages
   is radiometric dating. It is not carbon-14 dating, despite Hollywood
--
   rocks.

   Very little of what evolutionists present as evidence for their dogma
   is good science. In fact, the mere idea of naturalistic evolution is
   anti-science. If evolution were true and if a random chance process
   created the world, then that same process of chance created the human
   brain and its powers of logic. If the brain and its use of logic came
   about by chance, why trust its conclusions? To be consistent,
   evolutionists should reject their own ability to reason logically. Of
   course if they did that, they would have to reject their own dogma as
   well, compelling them to accept a creator. Evolution is a self-refuting
   religion.

   The types of changes evolution requires would be expected to provide
   many examples of missing links in virtually every layer of the geologic
   record. This is not the case. The geologic record is better explained

   Christian Theology

Evolution’s Effects on Christian Theology

   Unfortunately, as in Darwin’s day, much of the church has accepted
   millions of years and evolution as fact, without ever considering the
   underlying assumptions or how the acceptance of these assumptions
   undermines the biblical text and the gospel.

   For example, consider what happens when you attempt to add evolution
   into the Bible. Adam and Eve are no longer the first humans, and
   original sin goes out the window. This does irreparable damage to the
--
   that Christ is the last Adam, come to redeem us from the sin brought
   into the world through the first man, Adam (1 Corinthians 15:22, 45).
   If Adam were a mythical figure, which is what evolution demands, even
   in a Christianized form, the entire parallel between the two Adams and
   the kinsman redeemer concept is destroyed. By advocating evolution,
   theistic evolutionists are undermining the very tenets of Christianity.

   Those Christians who reject evolution but accept millions of years have
   an equivalent problem. Jesus, when explaining marriage to the
   Sadducees, referred to Adam and Eve as existing from the beginning of
--

   God tells us in Genesis exactly how he created the world, and even the
   order of events doesn’t match the evolutionary tale. In addition, one
   of the things that drives evolution is death. But the Bible teaches
   that death was introduced into the perfect world as a result of Adam’s
   sin. When Christians try to reinterpret God’s infallible Word based on
   the ideas of fallible men, it undermines the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Evolution and the Flood

   Further, attempting to combine evolution or millions of years with the
   biblical text forces Christians to reject the reality of the global
   flood of Noah’s day. If the fossil record was laid down before man,

   and the concept of biblical inerrancy.

   Evolution, whether couched in Christianized language or presented in
   its natural atheistic colors, remains an utterly bankrupt and failed
   hypothesis about the origin of the universe or the diversity of life on
   earth. In no instance has cosmological, geological, or biological
   evolution been demonstrated, and the most common evidences for
   evolution all have been debunked. Attempting to add evolution to
   Christianity is both unbiblical and irrational, since evolution itself
   is not science but anti-science. Neither the Bible nor empirical
   science support its claims.

Evolution Requires Faith

   For many, a belief in evolution comes from the desire to remove the
   need for God as Creator. Some would say evolution comes from what the
   evidence says to us. But evidence never speaks for itself, it’s always
   interpreted using your assumptions and starting points. And only when

   operates. Ironically, naturalism requires the violation of several

   God as their Creator and Organizer requires an immense amount of faith.
   While it is often used as a criticism of Christians, those who have an
   evolutionary worldview must accept all of these things by blind faith
   since there is no naturalistic explanation for the existence of these
   laws. While Christians also accept certain truths by faith, it is faith

     * Bad Design
       Some structures seem to show less-than-optimal design, and to some
       evolutionists this proves there is no creator. But a universe that
       has been cursed with degeneration for over 6,000 years won't
       maintain optimal design. The fact that we continue to survive is
       evidence of how good the original design was.
     * Vestigial Organs and Junk DNA
       Evolutionists claim that humans and other animals have organs and
       DNA leftover from evolution. But these reports are often based on
       evolutionary expectations. The appendix, for example, was once
       thought vestigial, but now we know its function. Even a true loss
