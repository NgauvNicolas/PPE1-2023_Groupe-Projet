Human evolution

   Human evolution is the lengthy process of change by which people
   originated from apelike ancestors. Scientific evidence shows that the
   physical and behavioral traits shared by all people originated from
--
   “pygmy chimpanzees”) and gorillas -- share a common ancestor that lived
   between 8 and 6 million years ago. Humans first evolved in Africa, and
   much of human evolution occurred on that continent. The fossils of
   early humans who lived between 6 and 2 million years ago come entirely
   from Africa.
--
   Scientists also debate over how to identify and classify particular
   species of early humans, and about what factors influenced the
   evolution and extinction of each species.

   Early humans first migrated out of Africa into Asia probably between 2

Paleoanthropology

   Paleoanthropology is the scientific study of human evolution.
   Paleoanthropology is a subfield of anthropology, the study of human
   culture, society, and biology. The field involves an understanding of
--
   their genes, body form, physiology, and behavior. Paleoanthropologists
   search for the roots of human physical traits and behavior. They seek
   to discover how evolution has shaped the potentials, tendencies, and
   limitations of all people. For many people, paleoanthropology is an
   exciting scientific field because it investigates the origin, over
   millions of years, of the universal and defining traits of our species.
   However, some people find the concept of human evolution troubling
   because it can seem not to fit with religious and other traditional
   beliefs about how people, other living things, and the world came to

The process of evolution

   The process of evolution involves a series of natural changes that
   cause species (populations of different organisms) to arise, adapt to
   the environment, and become extinct. All species or organisms have
   originated through the process of biological evolution. In animals that
   reproduce sexually, including humans, the term species refers to a
   group whose adult members regularly interbreed, resulting in fertile
--
   name. In this system, modern humans are classified as Homo sapiens.

   Evolution occurs when there is change in the genetic material -- the
   chemical molecule, DNA -- which is inherited from the parents, and
   especially in the proportions of different genes in a population. Genes
--
   and reproduction.

   Evolution does not change any single individual. Instead, it changes
   the inherited means of growth and development that typify a population
   (a group of individuals of the same species living in a particular
--
   work well until the environment changes. Over time, genetic change can
   alter a species' overall way of life, such as what it eats, how it
   grows, and where it can live. Human evolution took place as new genetic
   variations in early ancestor populations favored new abilities to adapt
   to environmental change and so altered the human way of life.

   Dr. Rick Potts provides a video short introduction to some of the
   evidence for human evolution, in the form of fossils and artifacts.
