   In recent years, an extension of the Darwinian framework is being
   considered for the study of prebiotic chemical evolution, shifting the
   attention from homogeneous populations of naked molecular species to
   populations of heterogeneous, compartmentalized and functionally
--
   the individual units, which require an adequate characterization as
   self-maintaining systems with an internal organization, and also in
   relation to their collective and long-term evolutionary dynamics, based
   on competition, collaboration and selection processes among those
   complex individuals. On these lines, a concrete proposal for the set of
--
   autonomous functional systems, at the interface between chemistry and
   biology, is provided.
   Keywords: chemical evolution, natural selection, origins of life,
   autonomous functional systems, prebiotic systems chemistry

   About a century and a half ago, in his book On the Origin of Species,
   Charles R. Darwin proposed natural selection (NS) as the main driving
   force that guides the evolution of species, conceived as a process of
   descent with modification from a common ancestor. Today we have
   overwhelming evidence to support that this process has been
   continuously shaping the living world over time on the Earth and, thus,
   it constitutes a central paradigm of biology. Darwinian evolution must
   have started, at the latest, with the first population of living cells,
   whose precise characteristics remain inaccessible to us, but whose
--
   population size/structure effects, symbiotic and mutualistic
   relationships, lateral gene transfer and sex), past and current
   biodiversity is therefore regarded as the outcome of evolutionary
   dynamics based on NS from LUCA [2].

--
   that chemical level [3–5]. This widespread conception is supported by
   two breakthroughs from last half-century molecular biology: (i) the
   development of in vitro molecular evolution technologies, which allowed
   to prove that populations of biopolymers with template properties
   could, indeed, change in time under artificial selective pressure
--

   As a result, some researchers have conjectured on a possible link
   between the emerging concept of chemical evolution and the established
   notion of biological evolution, considered as two different stages of a
   common natural process of matter complexification [12–15]. Uncovering
   possible mechanisms of chemical evolution that include early or
   minimalist versions of NS would then be crucial to understand how life
   originated on Earth—or, eventually, in a different extraterrestrial
   environment. Computational and theoretical studies carried out in the
   last years support that chemical kinetics may become evolutionary
   dynamics in populations of self-replicating molecules, or in
   collectively autocatalytic networks [16–18]. The overall idea behind
   these studies is that the evolutionary potential of such chemical
   systems would result from an increase in their dynamic stability as a
   consequence of the copying process or the cross-catalytic effects among
--
   stability? Is it because experimental scientists are not finding the
   right precursors and boundary conditions? Or is it because there are
   ‘evolutionary bottlenecks’—still to be identified and
   characterized—that must be overcome to trigger off such a behaviour?
   Secondly, is ‘kinetic control’ (i.e. the rate of template copying or
--
   ensure the necessary dynamic robustness of those prebiotic systems that
   would, eventually, lead to the onset of open-ended, biological
   evolution? If not, what other types of control mechanisms or basic
   functions should be taken into account at those initial stages? More
   precisely, regarding the emergence of Darwinian evolutionary dynamics,
   how large must a primary ‘functional/phenotypic space’ be for NS to get
   established, or become operational? And, finally, granted that cyclic
--
   for research on the origins of life [28–31]. In that context, figure 1
   introduces our view about the main stages and bottlenecks involved in
   the transition from chemical to biological evolution, with emphasis on
   the evolutionary importance of establishing efficient functional
   couplings within chemical systems, as we will argue in more detail
   below. Of course, chemical evolutionary pathways (bottom part of the
   figure) will surely cover a wider research area than those potentially
   conducive to prebiotic phenomena. Nevertheless, some of them should
--
   difficulties in establishing the ‘liveliness’ of these intermediate
   chemical systems, the necessity to start integrating organizational and
   evolutionary accounts of those kinds of complex (pre-bio)molecular
   phenomena is becoming less and less controversial, and that is
   precisely the area on which we focus this short critical review or
--

   Scheme of the different stages and bottlenecks that could have occurred
   during the transition from chemical to biological evolution. Among the
   complex and interacting chemical mixtures present on early Earth, only
   those that developed the first functional couplings were available for
--
   compartment, metabolism and replication (CMR) were tightly coupled. In
   turn, only those CMR systems that became capable of open-ended
   biological evolution (see explanation in the text) would show the
   long-term robustness required to follow the pathway to LUCA and its
   further diversification into the three domains of life.

2. Merging systems chemistry and evolutionary theory

   It is turning increasingly apparent that evolutionary theory can no
   longer keep the ‘black box’ of individuality closed. In particular, the
   triad ‘multiplication, variation and heredity’ cannot be simply assumed
--
   the way to biological phenomena should be made coherent with the
   Darwinian framework, which explains the dynamics taking place at a
   population level. Oversimplifications, imposing either the evolutionary
   framework (i.e. disregarding the internal complexity of the
   individuals) or the physiological/organizational one (i.e. disregarding
   the power of evolutionary mechanisms), have not worked satisfactorily
   [32,33]. Thus, the challenge for origins-of-life research is to make
   use of systems chemistry to identify and characterize mixtures of
--
   (i.e. ‘proto-organisms’, taken as assemblies of different chemical
   species with functional attributes—see below). In parallel, researchers
   should carefully examine the evolutionary consequences of having one
   type of individual or another in the population, in terms of the
   competitive and selective dynamics that take place at that collective
--

   Two additional arguments can be given to support the necessity of
   merging the new systems approach and evolutionary theory. First, all
   known living beings are made of highly diverse and intertwined
   components and transformation processes. Simplifying their origins to
--
   reductionist conjecture, which should not be taken for granted. Second,
   in order to turn operational and lead to systems of increasing
   complexity, evolution by NS should have required, from the beginning,
   individuals who provide a wide enough space to express a phenotypic
   variety [34,35]. For example, although molecular evolution through
   artificial selection for a given phenotype (e.g. a given aptamer or an
   engineered ribozyme) has been clearly demonstrated to take place
--
   have also supported, with different strength and motivations [37–40].
   However, this is bound to pay back soon in terms of the behavioural
   richness and evolutionary potential displayed by the more complex
   individuals that are drawn in the process. Somehow (as we explain in
   more detail in the sections below), reaching that initial threshold of
   complexity would make it possible, for chemical systems that overcome a
   first set of evolutionary bottlenecks (bottom part of figure 1) and
   keep relatively robust dynamics, to display a wide range of chemical
   couplings and functional behaviours that would allow them, in turn, to
--
   an important gap remains in our understanding of the processes that
   could have spontaneously supported the emergence, maintenance and
   evolutionary potential of such a precellular world. Especially, it must
   be noted that various chemical reactions traditionally involved in the
   artificial organic syntheses of RNA precursors are thermodynamically
--
   on Earth, what systems could overcome the apparent thermodynamic
   barrier to complexification and produce the rather intricate
   self-reproducing entities that initiated evolution in a Darwinian
   sense? There is no current answer for this riddle; therefore, we need a
   more general conceptual framework to understand chemical evolution. The
   required theory should account for the increase in complexity that
   occurred in prebiotic times, when chemistry was already complex and
--
   chemistry’ [28] during the last few years.

3. Chemical evolution through the development of autonomous functional
systems

   Our perspective considers an extension of the Darwinian framework for
   the study of prebiotic chemical evolution, but not in the traditional
   way that this has been carried out within the field of origins (i.e.
   searching for minimal self-replicating molecular systems [61–65]) or,
   more recently, with the inclusion of compartments under a similar
   scheme [60,66–68]. Instead, we suggest to apply an evolutionary account
   in the context of autonomous systems that are made of diverse
   combinations of chemical precursors (i.e. (bio)molecules and their
--
   enable researchers to design experiments of competition and selection
   among different types of such individuals, in order to test their
   actual dynamic robustness and evolutionary potential.

   Central to our account is the idea of function, a key concept in
--
   naturalizing an organizational conception of function, endowed with
   biological (i.e. physiological) meaning, but well-grounded in
   evolutionary systems chemistry.

   This perspective may hold some similarities with other theoretical
   schemes recently developed with the aim to explain the evolution of
   complex systems. Pascal et al. [14], for example, argue about a
   sequence of stages in which chemical systems of increasing stability or
--
   phenomena of various kinds may synchronize and produce novel, combined
   functional advantages, as a result of which ‘synergistic wholes’ would
   become the actual units of evolutionary change. However, even if this
   account of ‘function’ highlights it as a relational concept, as we do,
   the theoretical framework where it is embedded is very different,
   centred on the evolution of biological complexity. Corning and
   Szathmary develop their ideas from an evolutionary theory background,
   discarding the paradigms of ‘self-organization’ and classical
   ‘complexity sciences’ as significant contributions to the problem. In
--
   With that aim, a first approximation to a theory of autonomous
   functional systems is put forward in the next section, including
   ingredients from evolutionary biology and also from physics and
   chemistry, so that a better understanding about basic/minimal
   biological organization can be reached (i.e. about the actual units of
   life, not just about abstract ‘units of evolution’).

4. Outline of a theory of autonomous functional systems
--
   four different though interdependent types of control mechanisms that,
   according to our view, are fundamental requirements to assemble
   autonomous functional systems with evolutionary potential to become
   biological.

   heterogeneity in their composition (and complexity in their dynamic
   behaviour) would constitute proper candidates as units of selection in
   this extended framework to conceive prebiotic chemical evolution. As a
   result of that evolutionary process, one could envision further
   functional diversification and more efficient integration (through new
   coupling processes), which would confer higher dynamic robustness to
--
   anchored to the cell membrane [72]. Extensive experimental work during
   the last decades suggests that, at a very primitive stage of prebiotic
   chemical evolution, these boundaries were probably lipidic in nature,
   yet involving much simpler molecular structures and compositions than
   current ones [81–83].
--
   may have played the role of a primitive energy currency, while
   aminoacyl adenylates would represent an activated form of amino acids
   with a potential evolutionary connection with central molecules of the
   current translational machinery [89,90].

--
   self-maintenance is based on far-from-equilibrium reaction cycles in
   which there is a continuous turnover of the molecular species involved.
   This reveals an unavoidable evolutionary bottleneck in any realistic
   prebiotic scenario, and this is why the fourth vertex of the
   tetrahedron, related to the capacity of controlling variability, must
--
   experimental work, must be carried out in order to determine how
   prominent variability control turns out to be during the initial stages
   of the evolutionary process, when system reproduction is probably a
   rather stochastic event [66,91,92]. Yet, there is no doubt that it must
   come into play, along with the implementation of mechanisms of heredity
--
   more robust, etc.) will remain in the population. Therefore, a
   correlation between functional properties, coupling and integrative
   mechanisms, NS and evolutionary dynamics should be drawn.

   In this respect, our intuition is that during a first period of
   prebiotic chemical evolution, fitness would be simply associated with
   the dynamic stability of protocellular systems, taken as individual
   units. Then, as a result of the collective dynamics and interactions
--
   The new properties of these selected individuals (e.g. more reliable
   reproduction, higher control of variability and more efficient
   catalysis), would, in turn, allow for new evolutionary dynamics, with a
   stronger operational power of NS. This would get progressively closer
   to an open-ended evolution type of process, like the one we observe in
   the current biosphere (corresponding to the upper layer of figure 1).
   The key evolutionary transitions that could have occurred in the
   proposed scenario, together with the corresponding molecular entities
   involved, are depicted in figure 3. The later stages of prebiotic
   evolution (sketched on the right-hand side of figure 3) are also
   relevant, but lie outside the scope of the present contribution.
