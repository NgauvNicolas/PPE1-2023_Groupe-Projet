   instance, our fondness for sweet and savory foods results from our need
   to consume carbohydrates and proteins. Given their importance as an
   evolutionary trait, researchers around the world are investigating how
   taste receptors originated and evolved over a period of time. Obtaining
   these insights into the feeding behavior of organisms can help them

   lungfishes, and coelacanth were found to have TAS1R5.

   The researchers observed a close evolutionary relationship between
   TAS1R5, TAS1R1, and TAS1R2, indicating a shared ancestry between these
   genes. The cartilaginous fishes possess TAS1R6 exclusively. Notably,

   In addition to shedding light on the evolutionary history, the findings
   also have practical applications. Explaining these to us, Prof.
   Nishihara says, "These findings make it easier for us to deduce the
