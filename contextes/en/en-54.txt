Evolution

   Evolution is among the most substantiated concepts in science and is
   the unifying theory of biological science. Charles Darwin
   co-originated, with Alfred Russel Wallace, the theory of evolution by
   natural selection. His masterwork, the 1859 "Origin of Species,"
   offered ample evidence for evolution having occurred, as well as the
   first strong explanation for its mechanism, natural selection. Modern
   evolutionary theory incorporates these concepts: species change over
   time; genetic mutations are responsible for the changes; individuals
   with beneficial genetic mutations will survive preferentially compared
--
   genetic changes reproductively isolate a population, that population
   has become a new species. Here you'll find news and information on
   evolution and the battle with proponents of so-called creation science.
