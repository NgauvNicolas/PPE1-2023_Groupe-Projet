Background

   Although personal, familial, and community conflict with evolution have
   been documented in the literature, these scales require
   conceptualization as a construct and operationalization as a measure.
   The Scales of Conflict with Evolution Measure (SECM) instrument was
   developed in response to these needs. Using a construct validity
   framework, the content, internal structure, convergent, and substantive
--
   Equation Modeling (SEM), and follow up questioning. The conceptual
   utility of the instrument was explored by examining whether it added
   explanatory insights into evolution acceptance above and beyond
   religiosity, evolution knowledge, and background variables.

Results

   A literature review and expert consultation indicated that construct
   of evolutionary conflict perception should (i) encompass the
   hierarchical nature of human social structures (personal, family,
   community) and (ii) probe conflict as it relates to human values,
--
   operationalized as a nine-item rating scale measure. Using Rasch
   analyses of SECM responses from a diverse sample of > 1000 students
   studying evolution, the instrument met criteria of robust measurement,
   including: fit to model expectations; three-dimensional structure; high
   reliability; good rating scale function; measurement invariance with
--
   personal conflict, with family showing a stronger and modest impact,
   and (ii) personal conflict had a significant and modest causal impact
   on evolution acceptance above and beyond the contributions of
   religiosity, evolution knowledge, and background variables.

Conclusion

   The SECM is an easy-to-administer instrument to measure conflict with
   evolution and is supported by several forms of validity evidence. The
   SECM has potential for facilitating measurement of
   evolutionary conflict in educational settings, thereby raising
   instructor awareness of conflict levels in students, promoting rigorous
   evaluations of educational interventions designed to reduce conflict,
   and fostering conceptual advances in the field of evolution education.
   Future work is needed to gather additional forms of validity evidence
   and to test current validity claims in additional participant samples.
   SECM measures should also be incorporated into more complex SEM models
   that treat evolution knowledge and religiosity as part of the
   structural paths to evolution acceptance. Such models could provide
   insights into the most worthwhile targets for the development of
   educational interventions to mitigate conflict at multiple scales.

   The idea that individuals may harbor feelings of conflict with
   evolutionary principles, and that such conflict may be linked to their
   acceptance of evolution, has been discussed in the literature for
   decades (e.g., Clough 1994; Dagher and BouJaoude 1997; Graves 2019;
   Nehm et al. 2009; Scharmann and Harris 1992; Turner 1978). Many
   qualitative studies (and a few quantitative ones) confirm that feelings
   of conflict are an important variable to consider in the complex web of
   factors accounting for evolution acceptance (e.g., Barnes et al. 2020;
   Clough 1994; Ha et al. 2012; Konnemann et al. 2018; Nehm et al. 2009;
   Scharmann and Harris 1992). Conflict with evolution may be
   characterized in many ways: by its presence (i.e., yes, no), magnitude
   (high, low), sources (e.g., religion, societal implications), scales
--
   Konnemann et al. 2018; Mead et al. 2015; Nehm et al. 2009; Rissler et
   al. 2014; Scharmann and Harris 1992). Despite widespread recognition of
   its importance for evolution education research and practice, only a
   few studies in evolution education have empirically quantified conflict
   (e.g., Barnes et al. 2020; Konnemann et al. 2018; Nehm and Schonfeld
   2007), which is undoubtedly related to the paucity of
   easy-to-administer assessment tools for this topic (cf. Nehm and Mead
   2019). Developing robust measures of conflict with evolutionary ideas
   could: facilitate more frequent measurement in educational settings,
   raise instructor awareness of conflict levels in students, and foster
--
   conflict (e.g., Ha et al. 2015; Nehm et al. 2009; Scharmann and Harris
   1992). Such a measure could also lead to conceptual advances in the
   field of evolution education, as discussed below.

   First, feelings of conflict may impact evolution acceptance in ways
   that have not been precisely accounted for in prior work. For example,
   religiosity and evolution knowledge are commonly explored contributors
   to evolution acceptance (Mead et al. 2015; e.g., Bailey et al. 2011;
   Barone et al. 2014; Dagher and BouJaoude 1997; Deniz et al. 2008; Dunk
   et al. 2017; Glaze et al. 2014; Heddy and Nadelson 2013; Lombrozo et
--
   (e.g., Barnes and Brownell 2017; Glaze et al. 2014; Rissler et al.
   2014). However, while it has been shown that individuals may be
   conflicted about evolution because of their religious beliefs and
   cultures, they may also be conflicted for many other reasons (and
   religious respondents may not be conflicted at all). Nehm et al.
   (2009), for example, found that conflict with evolution had only a
   modest relationship with religiosity and was more strongly associated
   with degree of acceptance (Nehm et al. 2009). Additionally,
   cross-cultural studies in non-religious societies (e.g., China) have
   found only moderate levels of overall evolution acceptance (Ha et al.
   2019). Studies such as these indicate that the relationships between
   religiosity and acceptance require further scrutiny. This work also
   suggests that conflict with evolution has the potential to be important
   as (i) a mediator of the relationship between evolution acceptance and
   religiosity, and (ii) a unique explanatory factor of acceptance that
   encompasses a more expansive range of conflict measures beyond those
--

   Second, broadening the scope of conflict measurement (i.e., perceived
   family and community conflict with evolution in addition to personal
   conflict) could reveal contributors to personal conflict as well as
   their interrelationships. Prior work suggests that the attitudes
   perceived to be held by members of one’s social groups (e.g., family,
   friends, teachers, church members) impact personal conflict with–and
   acceptance of–evolution (e.g., Barnes et al. 2017b; Donnelly et al.
   2009; Hill 2014; Winslow et al. 2011). Affinity towards certain social
   groups (e.g., one’s community) could therefore be an important
   contributor to one’s personal conflict with evolution (e.g., personal
   level conflict). Individuals could have different causes of personal
   conflict (e.g., familial, community, religiosity, low evolution
   knowledge, combinations thereof), which could in turn contribute to
   different magnitudes of perceived conflict and evolution acceptance.
   Measuring perceptions of conflict at the family and community scale
   could therefore help to reveal important and measurable indirect causes
   of the observed differences in evolution acceptance that have been
   documented among demographic groups (see Bailey et al. 2011; Metzger et
   al. 2018; Sbeglia and Nehm 2018). In other words, it is possible that
--
   into an appropriate model, it would reveal their unique impacts on
   personal conflict, and could show that religiosity alone has a smaller
   relationship (direct or indirect) with evolution acceptance than is
   currently thought. Therefore, the SECM allows researchers to test if a
   respondent’s social relationships are additional important contributors
   (direct or indirect) to personal conflict and evolution acceptance.
   Overall, much more needs to be known about perceptions of personal,
   familial, and community conflict and their potential interactions with
--

   In summary, greater understanding of the scales of conflict with
   evolutionary ideas has potential for advancing conceptual understanding
   within the evolution education research community and for enhancing
   educational practices and outcomes relating to evolution (e.g.,
   reducing student conflict magnitudes). The Scale of Evolutionary
   Conflict Measure (SECM) was developed as a first step towards advancing
   work in this area. Below we begin with a description of the conceptual
--
Conceptual framework: measurement

   Evolution education researchers have approached the measurement of
   latent constructs (like conflict) from different conceptual and
   methodological perspectives (see Nehm and Mead 2019). Indeed, many
   types of reliability and validity evidence may be used to support
   claims about what evolution education instruments are able to measure
   (Campbell and Nehm 2013; Messick 1995). Validity and reliability
   evidence for the SECM was gathered in alignment with the Standards for
--
   robust measures of the desired latent construct (AERA et al. 2014). A
   latent construct is a feature that cannot be directly observed (e.g.,
   evolution acceptance, perceptions of conflict, religiosity). In order
   to generate robust measurement of a latent construct, specific
   characteristics of the underlying data must be present. These

   single topics or identities (e.g., those related to religion) given
   that too little is currently known about the diverse array of possible
   ways that conflict with evolution may manifest itself within
   respondents (Brem et al. 2003). We discuss the details of these core
   attributes below.
--
Scales of conflict: Personal, family, community

   An individual’s perception of conflict with evolution is likely to be
   situated within broader social contexts, and prior work suggests that
   the attitudes that are thought to be held by members of one’s social
   group (e.g., family, friends, teachers, church members) impact personal
   conflict with evolution (e.g., Barnes et al. 2017b; Donnelly et al.
   2009; Hill 2014; Winslow et al. 2011). Barnes et al. (2017b), for
   example, found that parental attitudes towards evolution were strongly
   associated with evolution acceptance. Likewise, Winslow et al. (2011)
   demonstrated that parents, and to a lesser extent church members, were
   strongly associated with personal views of evolution. Hill (2014) found
   that adolescent respondents who identified as religiously-devoted
   creationists were twice as likely to increase acceptance of evolution
   in early adulthood if they had friend networks in which not all members
   shared the respondent’s religious ideal type (religious ideal type is a
--
   2014). These studies suggest that the social groups to which
   individuals belong are related to personal conflict and overall
   acceptance of evolution.

   This prior work motivated the conceptualization of the construct
   ‘perception of evolutionary conflict’ at multiple, broadly defined
   social scales, namely: personal, family, and community. These three
   scales seek to capture the diversity of group memberships that a person

   perspectives, and engage in joint action in geographical locations or
   settings” (p. 1929). While the associations of family and community
   with perceptions of conflict and evolution acceptance have been
   advanced in the literature, researchers have yet to (i) develop
   measurement instruments that include such relationships or (ii)
--

   For each scale (personal, family, community), the perception of
   conflict with evolution was conceptualized as a construct that can be
   operationalized using several interrelated but distinct variables.
   Three variables from prior work (e.g., Barnes et al. 2017a, b; Brem et

   context and may be connected to broader aspects of identity. While
   relatively little work has focused on the non-religious aspects of
   beliefs, culture, and values as they relate to evolution acceptance
   (Brem et al. 2003 is an important exception), substantial work has been
   carried out on these elements (and their connections to identity) more
--
   1995; Southerland et al. 2001). Students hold beliefs about many
   topics, but religious beliefs in particular have been suggested to be
   strongly associated with perceptions of evolutionary conflict (Barnes
   et al. 2017a, 2017b; Rissler et al. 2014; Truong et al. 2018).
   Religious beliefs refer to the “specific beliefs one holds about the
   existence and influence of a deity” (Barnes and Brownell 2017, p. 3).
   Although evolution is often presented as incompatible with religious
   beliefs (e.g., Coyne 2015; Dawkins 2009), authors have shown that
   interventions designed to highlight their compatibility were associated
--
   assumptions about social complexity, spirituality, perceived fate
   control, cynicism, and rewards. A person’s culture may bear on
   perceptions of conflict with evolution if evolutionary theory is viewed
   as incompatible with shared assumptions or norms within their group,
   especially if a particular group enforces strict adherence to these
   norms. In particular, evolutionary ideas have been perceived to be at
   odds with one’s religious culture (defined as “the sociocultural norms
   that individuals experience related to religion.” [Barnes and Brownell
--
   the literal vs. non-literal interpretations of religious texts could
   explain the association between individuals’ perceptions of conflict
   with evolution and their specific religious affiliation (Dagher and
   BouJaoude 1997). Interventions designed to highlight the compatibility
   between evolutionary ideas and the perceptions of leaders of religious
   communities have been shown to be associated with an increase in
   acceptance (e.g., Manwaring et al. 2015). Other groups may also

   ethnicity and race are intimately related to, or are a part of the
   broader concept of culture (Causadias et al. 2018), and some race
   groups have been found to have lower levels of evolution acceptance
   than others (Bailey et al. 2011; Metzger et al. 2018; Sbeglia and Nehm
   2018). Unfortunately, few studies disaggregate evolution acceptance by
   race (Mead et al. 2015) and it is not currently known how the
   documented differences in acceptance relate to the magnitude or nature
   of perceived conflict with evolution. Nevertheless, although culture is
   known to be an important factor shaping perceptions, the assumption
   that the role of culture is stronger for minority than majority groups

   thought and action [idea of agency]”). These values are well-aligned
   with some of the negative perceived societal implications of
   evolutionary theory outlined and observed by Brem et al. (2003),
   including the naive perception that evolution implies a lack of control
   or self-determination and justifies selfishness and racial or ethnic
   discrimination. In one study, for example, the majority (56% and 65%,
   respectively) of college students reported that accepting evolutionary
   ideas makes it easier to justify racism and ethnic discrimination and
   harder to think of people as determining their own fate (Brem et al.
   2003). In summary, the literature supports the roles of beliefs,
   cultures, and values in the conceptualization of perceptions of
   conflict with evolution.

   university in the northeastern United States (N = 1179 for the pre-test
   [~ 90% participation rate]). All students were enrolled in introductory
   biology courses in which evolution was a major theme (nearly all units
   connected to evolution in some way). Participants were asked to self
   report background characteristics including age, gender, ethnicity or
   racial identity (White, Asian, or underrepresented minority [URM,

   and had representation from diverse backgrounds (in terms of race,
   ethnicity, and gender [see Table ​Table1]).1]). The sample was also
   chosen because evolution was a core idea in the courses, and
   accordingly was anticipated to spur thinking about evolution. In both
   semesters, the nature of science and evolution instruction occurred
   within the first few weeks of the semester. The pre-survey took place
   during the nature of science unit but before the evolution unit.

I-SEA

   The I‐SEA measures evolution acceptance (Nadelson and Southerland
   2012). It contains three item sets (eight items each, 24 total), each
   representing a different evolutionary scale or taxon: microevolution,
   macroevolution, and human evolution. The scale and taxonomic
   differences among item sets may be considered surface features that are
   irrelevant to expert-like evolutionary reasoning (Nehm and Ha 2011).
   The items have a five‐option response format (strongly disagree [SD],
   disagree [D], undecided [U], agree [A], and strongly agree [SA]).
   Responses were coded from 0–4, with 4 representing the highest
   evolution acceptance. Items with negative valences were reverse-coded
   as appropriate. When necessary, adjacent categories were collapsed for

   To address RQ3, we correlated latent measures of each respondent’s

   perceived compatibility between respondents’ families and their
   evolutionary ideas.

   members of a particular group may align their perceptions and
   perspectives with those of the group (Kahan et al. 2007), which is a
   phenomenon that has been explicitly connected to evolution acceptance,

   2017^1). Furthermore, exposures to social groups during
   human development are thought to calibrate peoples' perceptual systems

   social identity (e.g., the ideas and perspectives held by the social
   group with which one identifies) may have a causal relationship with
   one’s personal perceptions of conflict with evolution. Other aspects of
   identity (e.g., one’s values, cultures, and beliefs) may be indicative
   of (i.e. manifestations of) one’s latent level of perceived conflict
   with evolution.

Description of the measurement model
--
   were modeled among items with parallel forms, and among items that
   focused on the same taxon. Taxon is a feature of instrument items that
   has been hypothesized to impact evolutionary reasoning and test
   performance (Kalinowski et al. 2016; Opfer et al. 2012). The I-SEA was
   modeled as three factors (microevolution, macroevolution, and human
   evolution) as recommended by the instrument’s authors (Nadelson and
   Southerland, 2012), and error covariances were modeled among items with
   negative valence, among items about human microevolution, and among
   items about human macroevolution, all of which have been hypothesized
   as possible additional dimensions within the instrument (see Sbeglia
   and Nehm 2019). Religiosity was modeled as one factor and error
--
   latent traits of family and community conflict perception were modeled
   as being causal to personal conflict perception, and personal conflict
   perception was modeled as causal to the three scales of evolution
   acceptance. Family and community conflict were allowed to covary and
   the three factors of evolution acceptance were allowed to covary.
   Background variables (i.e., plan, prior biology coursework, level, ELL
   status, reading and writing ability, gender, race), evolution
   knowledge, and religiosity were modeled as having structural paths to
   all factors within the model, which removes the linear effects of these
--
   With these controls in place, we estimated the significance of the
   causal paths among the scales of conflict, and between the personal
   conflict and the scales of evolution acceptance by generating
   asymptotic standard errors of parameter estimates using the Delta
   method (Rosseel 2020b). This analysis allowed the investigation of the
   unique contribution of the causal paths between the SECM and evolution
   acceptance, above and beyond religiosity and evolution knowledge (RQ3).

Fit statistics
--
   The mean of raw SECM scores was 1.99/6 (sd = 2.09) for personal
   conflict, 2.60/6 (sd = 2.42) for family conflict, and 2.51/6 (sd =
   2.16) for community conflict. The three faculty experts in evolution
   education and social psychology agreed that the items in the SECM were
   clearly worded and appropriately connected to and representative of the
   construct and the existing literature. The mean raw score of the I-SEA
   was 26.57/32 (sd = 4.5) for microevolution, 25.62/32 (sd = 4.24) for
   macroevolution, and 24.69/32 (sd = 5.52) for human evolution. The mean
   raw score for the CANS was 10.69/24 (sd = 4.68), and religiosity was
   15.97/36 (sd = 10.18). Below we answer each of our research questions

RQ1: Does the SECM adhere to well-accepted criteria of robust measurement?

   We used responses on the SECM to model evolutionary conflict perception
   as a one-dimensional and as a three-dimensional construct (i.e., a
   separate construct for personal conflict, family conflict, and

   measurement of perceptions of conflict with evolution. The Wright map
   indicated that respondents were variable in their latent levels of the

   thresholds for all items within each scale were generally well-spaced
   at the higher end of the trait (i.e., at intermediate and high levels
   of the perception of conflict with evolution), producing only small
   gaps in measurement (see thresholds 2–4). However, the thresholds at
   the lower end of the trait (i.e., at low levels of perceived conflict
   with evolution) had larger gaps among them, likely resulting in less
   precise measurement (see thresholds 1–2). Although the precision with
   which respondents could be clustered into bins at the lower end of the

   We found no evidence of DIF across time for any scale of
   evolutionary conflict in the SECM (t-ratio < 2 for all interactions
   between items and time), suggesting measurement invariance for time in
   our sample. Therefore, the SECM appeared to measure the same construct

   There was a significant positive correlation between the latent
   measures of each respondent’s perception of their family’s conflict
   with evolution ideas (i.e., SECM Family item set) and the modified
   Inclusion of Others in Self [IOS] item (Spearman correlation: r = 0.50,
   p < 0.001).

RQ4: Do measures of conflict derived from the SECM contribute to the
explanation of evolution acceptance above and beyond the contributions of
religiosity and evolution knowledge?

   We used SEM (specifically LVPM) to evaluate the hypothesized causal
   relationships among the SECM scales, and between the SECM and evolution
   acceptance (Fig. 6). Our measurement model had acceptable fit to the
   data (see Table ​Table3)3) and no posteriori changes to the model were

   conflict, family conflict, community conflict) and each I-SEA factor
   (i.e., microevolution acceptance, macroevolution acceptance, human
   evolution acceptance) (represented here by a box with arrows emerging
   from it), which effectively controlled for the effects of these
   variables on all path coefficients. Assuming a correct underlying
   model, the path coefficients shown in the model reflect the magnitude
   of the causal impact of these variables, holding all other variables
   constant (including evolution knowledge, religiosity, and background
   variables). The disturbances for each factor are represented by a

   Assuming a correct underlying model, the perceptions of family and
   community positively impacted perceptions of personal conflict with
   evolution, which subsequently negatively impacted evolution acceptance.
   Specifically, controlling for all other modeled variables (including
   background variables, religiosity and evolution knowledge), a one
   standard deviation increase in perceptions of family conflict and
   community conflict caused, on average, a 0.54 and 0.15 standard

   acceptance (Fig. 6, Table ​Table4).4). Therefore, personal conflict had
   a moderately-sized causal impact on all scales of acceptance that was

   The purpose of this study was to advance empirical and conceptual work
   in evolution education by developing an instrument capable of
   productively measuring perceptions of conflict with evolution (SECM).

   The items were also found to be measurement invariant across time,
   suggesting that respondents interpreted items similarly before and
   after evolution instruction. Therefore, the SECM could be used to make
   meaningful inferences about changes in perceptions of conflict with
   evolution in response to instruction or targeted interventions. Several
   researchers have proposed frameworks for guiding the development of
   interventions that target the compatibility of evolution and religion
   (e.g., Barnes and Brownell 2017) and the bounded nature of science
   (e.g., Nelson et al. 2019). Results from researchers who have
   implemented curricular interventions aimed at reducing conflict
   (particularly between religion and evolution) suggest that it is a
   malleable trait that can be successfully impacted by instruction (e.g.,
   Barnes and Brownell 2017; Nehm and Schonfeld 2007; Truong et al. 2018).

   and modestly with the Inclusion of Others in Self (IOS) instrument,
   which measured the perception of compatibility between family and
   evolutionary ideas. This modest correlation provides convergent
   validity evidence for the SECM, but also suggests that the perception
   of conflict (or incompatibility) (targeted by the SECM) and the
   perception of compatibility (targeted by the IOS) are not necessarily
   direct opposites of one another from a measurement perspective. More
   work on the perception of compatibility (or harmony) with evolution
   could offer different inferences and is clearly warranted.

   be valuable for other aspects of the SECM.

Using the SECM to advance evolution education research

   In order to illustrate how the SECM could advance understanding of the
   complex web of variables connected to evolution acceptance, SEM was
   used to evaluate hypothesized causal relationships among the SECM
   scales, and between the SECM and evolution acceptance. Several other
   variables shown to be important in the literature (e.g., knowledge,
   religiosity) were also collected to examine if and how the SECM
--
   conflict, with family showing a stronger and modest impact, and (ii)
   personal conflict had a significant and modest causal impact on all
   scales of evolution acceptance above and beyond the contributions of
   religiosity, evolution knowledge, and background variables. We discuss
   the implications of each of these findings below.

   It is notable that both family and community conflict had unique casual
   impacts on personal perceptions of conflict with evolution. Few studies
   have directly compared the strength of the association of community and
   family on personal conflict. Studies that have collected data at both
--
   as key roles in determining their perspectives on STEM-related career
   choice. Therefore, taken together, these studies suggest that
   perceptions of community conflict with evolution may be an important
   contributor to the personal conflict perception of URMs. Furthermore,
   if the experience of conflict within the classroom is generally agreed
--
   the differential contributors to personal conflict should be an
   important target for study and intervention. Reducing perceived
   conflict with evolution may therefore be an important goal that extends
   beyond its relationship with evolution acceptance. This is an avenue of
   research that has not to our knowledge been explored empirically.

--
   these reasons, conflict may negatively impact students’ well-being and
   academic performance. We therefore join other authors (e.g., Mead et
   al. 2015) in advocating for the disaggregation of data in evolution
   education by key identity variables (such as race) that could
   contribute to feelings of conflict and exclusion.

   We also report that personal conflict had a significant and modest
   causal impact on all scales of evolution acceptance above and beyond
   the contributions of religiosity, evolution knowledge, and background
   variables. Human evolution acceptance showed the largest impact of
   personal conflict, which indicated that while the perception of
   conflict with evolution was important for all scales of evolution
   acceptance, it may be most important for the acceptance of human
   evolution. These results suggest that the perception of conflict with
   evolution may in fact impact evolution acceptance in a manner that is
   not accounted for by other available variables. These results do not
   suggest that all theoretically important variables have been accounted
--
   could be an important contributor to perceptions of conflict.^2 As a
   next step, researchers could consider incorporating the SECM into more
   complicated SEM models that treat evolution knowledge and religiosity
   (as well as other theoretically important variables, such as religious
   denomination [see Jensen et al. 2019^3]) as part of the structural
--

   The SECM is a first (and admittedly incomplete) step towards more
   completely operationalizing and measuring conflict with evolution;
   different conceptual frameworks and measurement approaches than we have
   used may be equally valuable. Although our psychometric work was fairly
--
   extent to which the outcomes or benefits proposed by the test are
   realized (AERA et al. 2014). For example, if decreasing the perception
   of conflict with evolution decreases anxiety, increases feelings of
   belonging in the classroom, and increases evolution acceptance, then
   reducing conflict through targeted interventions should display these
   outcomes. Furthermore, if low evolution acceptance and the perception
   of conflict with evolution are barriers for students persisting in
   biology majors and seeking evolution-related careers, level of conflict
   should be a significant indirect or direct predictor of these outcomes.
   Clearly, this study is one very small step towards advancing work on
   measuring conflict with evolution.

Conclusion

   This paper introduced the SECM, an easy-to-administer instrument
   designed to measure perceptions of conflict with evolution at multiple
   scales. The SECM embodies three attributes discussed in the literature:
   (i) it addresses the hierarchical nature of human social structures
--
   the subscales may be implemented separately or together, and used in
   several theory-driven orientations. Generating robust measures of the
   perception of conflict with evolution using the SECM has the potential
   for advancing understanding of the factors accounting for evolution
   acceptance, and for informing practices and outcomes relating to
   evolution education.
