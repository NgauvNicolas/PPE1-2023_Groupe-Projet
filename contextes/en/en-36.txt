Theory of Evolution

   The theory of evolution is a shortened form of the term “theory of
   evolution by natural selection,” which was proposed by Charles Darwin
   and Alfred Russel Wallace in the nineteenth century.

   the word, because it could not be subjected to testing that might
   support it or prove it wrong. In science, the word “theory” indicates a
   very high level of certainty. Scientists talk about evolution as a
   theory, for instance, just as they talk about Einstein’s explanation of
   gravity as a theory.

   A theory is an idea about how something in nature works that has gone
   through rigorous testing through observations and experiments designed
   to prove the idea right or wrong. When it comes to the evolution of
   life, various philosophers and scientists, including an
   eighteenth-century English doctor named Erasmus Darwin, proposed
   different aspects of what later would become evolutionary theory. But
   evolution did not reach the status of being a scientific theory until
   Darwin’s grandson, the more famous Charles Darwin, published his famous
   book On the Origin of Species. Darwin and a scientific contemporary of
   his, Alfred Russel Wallace, proposed that evolution occurs because of a
   phenomenon called natural selection.

   This means that if an environment changes, the traits that enhance
   survival in that environment will also gradually change, or evolve.
   Natural selection was such a powerful idea in explaining the evolution
   of life that it became established as a scientific theory. Biologists
   have since observed numerous examples of natural selection influencing
   evolution. Today, it is known to be just one of several mechanisms by
   which life evolves. For example, a phenomenon known as genetic drift
   can also cause species to evolve. In genetic drift, some
