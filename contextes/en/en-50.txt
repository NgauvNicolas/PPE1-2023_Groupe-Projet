   bodies and behaviour. It is one of the processes by which species
   change from generation to generation, and is a crucial element of the
   theory of evolution.

   A classic example of natural selection at work is the origin of

   extinction.

   There is also more to evolution than natural selection. Species can
   change in a more undirected way by a process called genetic drift, in
   which certain genetic variants become more common despite not having

   Finally, many organisms have cultural behaviours such as tool use, and
   these feed back onto traditional evolutionary processes like natural
   selection.

   Evolution is also chaotic, meaning that the changes it produces are not
   always predictable. This is partly because it relies on random
   mutations to produce the raw material on which natural selection can

   when they are needed.

   Nowadays there is also a new force in evolution: humans. We are
   exerting new selection pressures on many species, changing them in
   unpredictable ways.
