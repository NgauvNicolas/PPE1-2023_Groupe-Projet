Abstract

   The idea of biological evolution is not accepted by many people around
   the world, with a large disparity amongst countries. Some factors may
   act as obstacles to the acceptance of evolution, such as religion, a
   lack of openness to experience, and not understanding the nature of
   science. Although the strength of the association between evolution
   acceptance and non-scientific factors varies among studies, it is often
   assumed that resistance to evolution is the byproduct of a religious
   background. Some studies are even more specific and try to associate
   the acceptance of evolution with precise religious affiliations. We
   aimed to explore the strength of associations among nationality,
   religion, and the acceptance of evolution by students using multiple
   correspondence analysis (MCA) and statistical tools, with nationwide
   samples from two different countries. Here, we show that wider
   sociocultural factors predict the acceptance of evolution to a higher
   degree than a religious background. We carried out two nationwide data
   collections that allowed us to compare differences in the acceptance of
   evolution in Italy and Brazil by high school students who declare to
   belong to the same religion in the two countries. Roman Catholic
   students showed significant differences between the two countries, and
--
   Christians within Brazil. Our conclusions support those who argue that
   religious affiliation is not the main factor in predicting the level of
   evolution acceptance. The sociocultural environment and the level of
   evolutionary knowledge seem to be more important in this regard. These
   results open up new interpretative perspectives and provide a better
   understanding of attitudes towards evolution.

Introduction

   The acceptance of evolution has been a central topic in evolution
   education in at least the last three decades [1,2]. Researchers have
   examined numerous factors that may act as obstacles to the acceptance
   of evolution, such as religiosity, knowledge of evolutionary theory,
   the understanding of the nature of science, scientific aptitudes, and
   psychological conflicts, among others [3–6]. A major association seems
--

   A systematic literature review of the current state of research
   regarding students’ and teachers’ acceptance of evolution across Europe
   found that the level of acceptance of evolution in different
   educational settings is ambiguous. The authors argue that similar
   samples and a standardized assessment of the acceptance of evolution
   are necessary for cross-country comparisons [7].

   The use of different instruments to measure evolution acceptance could
   be a cause of conflicting research results. A variety of tests have
   been proposed, including the Measure of Acceptance of the Theory of
   Evolution (MATE), which has been widely used for more than 20 years and
   recently revised [8], the Inventory of Student Evolution Acceptance
   (I-SEA) [9], the Generalized Acceptance of EvolutioN Evaluation (GAENE)
   [10], etc. It should be considered that the studies cited above differ
   in their contexts of comparison in relation to ages, countries, and
--
   measurement statistics. However, inconsistencies in the results were
   found even in the analysis of the same group with different instruments
   measuring the acceptance of evolution.

   Barnes et al. [6] conducted separate analyses using six different
   evolution acceptance instruments with the same group of students, a
   large sample of around 2,300 university students. The instruments were
   administered in a random order to avoid bias due to differential
   attention and response readiness. The results were surprising and
   showed that different instruments led to different results for the
   measure of evolution acceptance, including conflicting ones. These
   results may also be interpreted as an indication that some instruments
   need methodological revisions in the search for possible distortions
--

   Additionally, the research findings revealed a complex relationship
   between understanding evolutionary concepts (e.g. natural selection)
   and evolution acceptance [10–13]. The same lack of consensus exists
   when measuring the level of evolution knowledge, given that several
   alternative assessment tools are available and may lead to different
   results [14,15]. A study with secondary school students (aged 14–16) in
   the United Kingdom found that teaching genetics before teaching
   evolution had a significant impact on improving evolution understanding
   but did not result in a significantly increased acceptance of evolution
   [16]. This reflects a weak correlation between the knowledge and
   acceptance of evolution, which also appears to be present in
   undergraduate students. In Chilean students of 15–16 years old, it was
   found that including instruction on the nature of science in the class
   on evolution improved their acceptance significantly [17].

   Kuschmierz et al. [7] identified 56 papers from the period of 2010–2020
   regarding students’ and teachers’ knowledge and acceptance of evolution
   across 29 European countries. However, according to the authors, the
   research findings were hard to compare due to the application of
--
   data from European countries. In addition, the ambiguous results of the
   research demonstrate multiple challenges regarding measurement of
   evolution education, such as (a) inadequate definitions of key
   constructs (attitudes, acceptance, knowledge, and understanding are
   often not defined or inconsistently used in publications); (b) the
   application of diverse measurement instruments (different evolution
   acceptance instruments may produce different results, even when applied
   to the same population); (c) the multidimensionality of knowledge about
   evolution (most instruments focus on single evolutionary constructs,
   such as natural selection and related concepts).

   The authors [18] then developed an instrument to measure attitudes and
   understanding across Europe and beyond, called the “Evolution Education
   Questionnaire on Acceptance and Knowledge” (EEQ). The measurement
   instrument was translated into several European languages, in the
--

   Religious beliefs are among the factors most investigated as predictors
   to the low acceptance of evolution in several studies, especially among
   some age groups, religious affiliations, and nationalities, mainly
   Christian American students [10,20,21]. Barnes et al. [22] conducted a
   study with 1898 students in eight states of the United States and found
   that 56.5% of students perceived that evolution is atheistic, with a
   higher percentage of Catholic and other Christian students. This
   perception among students may lead to an apparent conflict between
   their personal religious beliefs and evolution [23].

   In addition to Christians, those of the Muslim faith have been
   investigated, although the debate between several religions and
   evolution is more typically addressed in Western contexts [24].
   However, multifactorial models have found that once religiosity and
   other measures are accounted for, the amount of variance in acceptance
   of evolution is greatly reduced [13,25]. Mantelas and Mavrikaki [26]
   examined the acceptance of evolution and its relationship with
   religiosity among Greek university biology students. A rather weak
   correlation was found between the two factors.

   Evolution is controversial among both religious and non-religious
   individuals, and inconsistent views of evolution have been evidenced in
   both groups [24,27]. The picture appears to not be static, as a sample
   of U.S. education professionals with a wide range of religious
   commitments showed a significantly higher level of acceptance than
   previous studies [28]. Moreover, the level of public acceptance of
   evolution has increased in the United States in the last decade, and
   education seems to play a significant role [29]. Thus, in certain
   social contexts, religiosity may be a main component by itself, while
   in others, evolution acceptance may depend on other factors.

   There is a tendency, which cannot be taken as unanimous, that
   associates the belief in any God (deism) as intrinsically
   anti-evolutionist [30]. One can easily remember the several references
   to the "Creator" in the Origin of Species, especially in its second
   edition, showing that this direct link is far more complex than it may
--
   and beliefs do not allow for a narrow focus on the search for one
   isolated variable. However, it has been often assumed that resistance
   to evolution is somehow a byproduct of religious background, especially
   in the United States [22,31].

   Some researchers have focused closely on specific religious groups,
   such as Pentecostal Christians, known for their literal reading of
   sacred texts and strong opposition to evolution [32]. One study was
   carried out in Brazil, where these religious groups have a growing
   influence, and tried to establish a direct correlation between the
   frequency of Pentecostal Christians and the level of rejection of
   evolution between the students of two high schools [33]. A written
   instrument was created, based on a well-known one [8], and 10 students
   were invited for semi-structured interviews [33]. Although no direct
   correlation was found, the author concluded that religious beliefs are
   important elements that shape students’ ideas, possibly introducing
   “constraints that might hinder the understanding of evolutionary
   theory” [33, p. 63].

   Another piece of research developed a survey instrument with a
   nationwide sample of the British population about the general public’s
   views of evolution. As the study had a closer focus on religion, there
   was oversampling of five different religious affiliations: Anglicans
   (or Episcopalians), Catholics, Muslims, Pentecostal Christians, and
   Independent Evangelical Christians. The results showed a strong
   rejection of evolution by Muslims, Pentecostals, and Independent
   Evangelical Christians, contrary to the position of non-religious
   people, Anglicans, and Catholics, who showed high agreement to
   statements about human evolution. The study revealed that the frequency
   of religious service attendance is a large significant predictor of
   evolution rejection among most religious groups [24, p.88]. The general
   conclusion was that religious affiliation and the degree to which
   individuals participate in religious practices affect the acceptance of
   evolution as a valid theory.

   A recent study with a large sample of almost 8000 undergraduate biology
   students in different states of the United States searched for
   correlations between religious affiliation and variables such as the
   acceptance and understanding of evolution. Using a Likert scale
   instrument, they found that Muslim undergraduate students showed
   slightly higher evolution acceptance levels than Protestant students,
   but significantly lower levels than Catholic, Jewish, Buddhist, and
   Hindu students [34].
--
   However, some researchers have been questioning the common view that
   religious affiliation is the main factor to the acceptance of
   evolution. They argue that it is more likely that people form beliefs
   congruent with their broad cultural identity, which includes but is not
   limited to religious belief [35,36]. However, most articles arguing in
   this direction are case studies and philosophical or legal debates
   about evolution vs creation in the school curricula, mostly in the U.S.
   context [37]. In addition, with few exceptions, such as the reports by
   Miller et al. [2] and Clément [36], most studies have focused on a
--
   number of Catholic Christians in the world, and Italy is the hub of
   Roman Catholicism. They follow the same basic regulations from the
   Vatican, which include explicit views on biological evolution and a
   non-literal interpretation of sacred texts. However, there are deep
   sociocultural differences due to many complex factors, including
--
   a significant rise in the creationist movement in Brazil [39]. One
   Brazilian state minister declared in 2019 that the Evangelical Church
   should fight against the introduction of the theory of evolution in
   public schools, before her recent nomination [40]. Another member of
   the federal government declared in an open ceremony that Intelligent
   Design (ID) should be introduced in Brazil’s public schools as “a
   counterpoint to the theory of evolution”, assuming that there would be
   a “creationist theory” to be taught in science lessons starting at the
   primary level [41]. Research carried out in Brazil had already showed
--
   Research on the public understanding of science has been frequent, with
   nationwide surveys since 2004 [43]. However, specific research on the
   knowledge and acceptance of evolution in Italy was scarce at that time.
   Whereas Italy is included in broader international surveys, it accounts
   only for a few targeted case studies that vary in types of audience and
   goals. Despite the scarce data, researchers indicated that rejection of
   the evolutionary theory is neither widespread nor deeply rooted in
   Italian society [44], which was confirmed by Pew Research Center
   reports. The same source recently confirmed the tendency of the rise of
   the creationist perspective in Brazil within adults, with a
   considerably lower acceptance of evolution by Christians in Brazil
   (51%) than in Italy (74%) [45].

--
   advantage of an international project focusing on youngsters who were
   beginning high school level in both countries, we prepared separate
   sets of questions about evolution so that we had the very same
   questions answered by students of the same age in the same time frame,
   during the first months of the year 2014. Targeting students at the

   comparing the concepts of belief and acceptance. Differences between
   them have long been discussed in the philosophical literature and the
   specific field of evolution education [25,27,43,49]. The overall
   picture takes belief as a subjective disposition to consider p. simply
   as a premise under the influence of the wide cultural context. A
--

   The instrument used in the recent work by Kuschmierz et al. [19],
   ATEVO, relies on eight items with statements about evolution, and
   students show their degree of agreement with each of them [51]. In the
   German context, the acceptance of evolution is defined as a “positive
   attitude” (“positive Einstellung”) towards evolution. In this regard,
   “attitude” (“Einstellung”) is defined as the level of association
   between a term or fact and its subjective evaluation, in terms of
--
   of ATEVO test may be the result of very different processes. On the one
   hand, “it remains unknown whether a person answers negatively for most
   items about evolution because he/she has a ‘bad feeling’” (“schlechtes
   Gefühl”) about evolution, in the sense of a preexisting emotional
   refusal to think on the subject. On the other hand, the rejection may
   have been the result of a long reflection leading to a rational
   conclusion that evolution is not plausible [51, p. 12].

   We adopted a clear definition of evolution acceptance despite the
   complexity of the discussion on the subject in different languages,
   taking acceptance as the expression of explicit recognition of the
   objective validity of known scientific statements about evolution under
   absolute anonymity. This definition considers two steps. The first is
   associated with scientific statements about evolution, which must be
   clear and well known, avoiding issues under discussion, for instance,
   about the origin of life. Students must show not only a positive
   attitude towards evolution but also express clearly that a statement
   based on biological evolution is considered a valid premise to
   construct a judgement about the real world.

--
   Therefore, anonymous participation must be guaranteed to every person
   who is responding to questions about religion-related subjects, such as
   biological evolution, especially when surveys are carried out within
   conservative social contexts. Under secrecy, a person may accept a
   proposition as a valid premise for argumentation, making inferences,
--
   environment and were told their answers would be under absolute
   anonymity. Previous analyses of this data bank showed surprisingly high
   mean scores of evolution acceptance within fundamentalist religious
   groups in Italy and Brazil [54]. This was also the case in a previous
   survey using a different methodology, carried out in 2010–11, where
   roughly half of Evangelical high school students in Brazil declared
   under absolute anonymity that their religion was not opposed to
   evolution [55].

   In line with the tantalizing results of the study by Barnes et al. [6]
--
   instrument was based on Likert scale items but allowed a separated
   section, which we added in both countries. However, we considered a
   different approach for these evolution items, as we were going to
   present students with factual statements that were regarded as right or
   wrong by scientists.
--
   spectrum of respondents [57]. Therefore, Likert scales may not be a
   good choice with statements expressing well-known scientific facts. In
   addition, in the case of theories of evolution, factuality is supported
   by the school context in which the questionnaires were filled out. The
   battery of items on evolution was proposed with dichotomous questions,
   given that each of them can have minimal variability.

   When evolution is considered, opinions can be expressed in terms of
   favorable and unfavorable subjective statements, such as “There is a
   significant body of data which supports evolutionary theory” [33],
   “There is strong, reliable evidence to support the theory of evolution”
   [24], or “I think there is reliable evidence to support the theory that
   describes how humans were derived from ancestral primates” [33]. In

Survey instrument

   We sought to measure evolution acceptance based on five clear
   statements related to the evolutionary theory: Earth age, the fossil
   record, common ancestry, and the origin of human beings. We included an
   item about understanding, related to deep time, as it has been
   considered a relevant barrier to evolution acceptance [59], while
   statements about human evolution are highly controversial even amongst
   biology teachers [60]. As mentioned before, the section of evolution
   provided scientific statements as a separated set of items as part of a
   longer questionnaire within the Relevance of Science Education (ROSE)

   Eight items related to evolution were offered to the students under a

   true or false, and a gentle refusal to answer the question (“I wouldn’t

   data (gender, age, living place), some socioeconomic questions, 73
   Likert scale items, and the true/false section on evolution (G

   group compared to, for instance, the group in Britain who responded to
   a survey about evolution [24], where the proportion of Anglicans and
   Lutherans was far higher than Pentecostal Christians and Independent
   Evangelical Christians, the two main groups in Brazil.

   themselves than among Brazilian Catholics and Brazilian non-Catholics
   Christians. This indicated that sociocultural factors played a more
   important role in the acceptance of evolution than religion itself. If
   the index was lower than 1 (IntcI<1) this indicated the opposite, that
   religion played a major role.
--
   Previous analyses of this sample already showed significant differences
   between Brazilian and Italian students [54,63]. It was clear that when
   human evolution was specifically the focus, the level of acceptance of
   evolution was lower in both countries. The same broad results were
   found in places where the context is particularly important for the
   historical development of the theory of evolution, such as the
   Galapagos Islands [72,73]. These analyses suggest that religion plays a
   considerable role in the level of support for evolution. S1 and S2

Discussion

   Research on evolution education faced a big challenge after the
   surprising findings showing that different instruments lead to
   different rates of agreement/rejection of evolution in the same student
   population [6]. We tried to show that some instruments could have had
   problems in terms of their methodology, implying distortions for the
--
   distortions can explain, at least in part, the mentioned puzzle. In
   addition, there is not consensus in the educational community about how
   important religion is for the acceptance of evolution.

   We presented a new instrument, stating some principles on how to
   evaluate students’ opinions concerning evolution, asking clear
   positions about well-known statements on the subject and using
   nationwide samples of students of the same age (around 15 years old)
--
   on the well-known instrument “MATE”, keeping the same wording in the
   revised version [8] for the statement about humans, revealing
   difficulties of evolution in 34 countries [2]. Many studies have shown
   that when the human species is concerned, opinions about evolution tend
   to be extreme, with some people considering evolution for all organisms
   except our species [60]. This is perhaps the best item to test the
   hypothesis we have been examining, as the number of respondents of both
--
   knowledge was found in both Christian denominations in Brazil. This not
   only adds evidence to the importance of understanding this important
   concept for evolution acceptance, but also shows that education and
   religion have a strong link with nationality, adding evidence to
   previously published studies [6,24]. In our case, Italian Catholics had
   a higher acceptance as well as a higher level of understanding of
   evolution than Brazilian ones. Independent recent research obtained
   similar results, showing that Catholic and Evangelical Brazilian
   university students had low levels of knowledge about evolution [74].

   Notwithstanding this general picture found after the MCA, additional
   evidence in numerical terms supports the idea that religion alone does
   not play a major role in the acceptance of evolution, with the relative
   size of differences obtained by the Intercultural Index (IntcI). It
   tended to show small numbers (IntcI<1) in cases where religion played a
--
   a common ancestor. This can be regarded as a clear-cut, widely known,
   scientific principle of common ancestry, and a basic principle for
   biological evolution. The calculated Intercultural Index for item G79
   (“Humans are descended from other primate species”) was high (IntcI =
   1.889), showing that differences within Catholics were almost twice as
--

   The general picture shows that religion plays a less important role in
   the acceptance of evolution than nationality, which should be regarded
   as the wide socio-cultural environment, including religion and
   education. Children develop a range of different worldviews, which can
   affect their position towards science and scientific statements [75].
   However, the acceptance of evolution cannot be seen as a simple output
   of a given worldview but as a complex result of several influences.

--
   scale numbers into true/false answers. Then, the Intercultural Index
   presented here could objectively show the relative importance of
   religion for evolution acceptance. If our results are to be confirmed
   in the future, this could provide considerable consequences for making
   concrete recommendations for evolution education to religious students
   in conservative and anti-science environments.

   It is important to keep in mind that the picture presented here is only
   one frame of a long film, as values are changing very rapidly, even in
   religious settings. For instance, the level of acceptance of evolution
   has improved considerably within members of some conservative Christian
   denominations whose teachings are informed by cultural barriers to
   evolution [35]. Unfortunately, change can also be noticed in the
   opposite direction, with conservative anti-evolution groups and
   religious denominations showing a growing influence around the world,
   Brazil included [39–41,74].

   Reviewer #1: This article examines compare acceptance of evolution in
   high school students in Italy and Brazil, specifically looking at 1)
   the overall differences in acceptance between countries 2) whether
   level of acceptance is associated more strongly with a specific
   Christian denomination (Roman Catholic) in both countries, and 3)
   whether acceptance of evolution by both Catholic and non-Catholic
   Christian students within each country are more similar to each other.
   The authors found that the level of evolution acceptance is more
   similar among students within each country than among Roman Catholics
   in both countries. They conclude that "the sociocultural environment
   and level of evolutionary knowledge" is more important than the
   specific religious affiliation they studied (from the abstract), and
   that "religion playing a less important role for the acceptance of
   evolution that nationality" (from lines 648-649). It is an elegant
   study and should be published.

   Answer: Our study did not aim at studying deeply the variable we were
   interested for: religion. We tried to throw light on the influence of
   religion in evolution acceptance at a certain age level, with
   probabilistic nationwide samples of two countries with large numbers of
   students who declare themselves as Roman Catholic. It is a far more
--
   still contradictory and require further investigation. An example of
   inconsistencies found so far is that some studies report a strong
   relationship between evolution acceptance and religious beliefs, while
   other studies report a weak relationship between them [6]. The use of
   different instruments to measure evolution acceptance could be a cause
   of such inconsistent research results."

   imprecise numeric measures. Our conclusion indicates not only that

   results.

   Answer: We have included five paragraphs and seven references, with
   studies on acceptance of evolution and Christian denominations of
   similar age level as ours in countries such as India and Chile. The
   paragraphs and references are:

   “A systematic literature review of the current state of research
   regarding students’ and teachers’ acceptance of evolution across Europe
   found that the level of acceptance of evolution in different
   educational settings is ambiguous. The authors argue that similar
   samples and a standardized assessment of the acceptance of evolution
   are necessary for cross-country comparisons [7].

--

   A study with secondary school students (aged 14–16) in the United
   Kingdom found that teaching genetics before teaching evolution had a
   significant impact on improving evolution understanding but did not
   result in a significantly increased acceptance of evolution [16]. This
   reflects a weak correlation between the knowledge and acceptance of
   evolution, which also appears to be present in undergraduate students.
   In Chilean students of 15–16 years old, it was found that including
   instruction on the nature of science in the class on evolution improved
   their acceptance significantly [17].

   Kuschmierz et al. (2020) [7] identified 56 papers from the period of
   2010–2020 regarding students’ and teachers’ knowledge and acceptance of
   evolution across 29 European countries. However, according to the
   authors, the research findings were hard to compare due to the
   application of different instruments and the assessment of different
--
   reasonably comparable data from European countries. In addition, the
   ambiguous results of the research demonstrate multiple challenges
   regarding measurement of evolution education, such as (a) inadequate
   definitions of key constructs (attitudes, acceptance, knowledge, and
   understanding are often not defined or inconsistently used in
   publications); (b) the application of diverse measurement instruments
   (different evolution acceptance instruments may produce different
   results, even when applied to the same population); (c) the
   multidimensionality of knowledge about evolution (most instruments
   focus on single evolutionary constructs, such as natural selection and
   related concepts).

   The authors [18] then developed an instrument to measure attitudes and
   understanding across Europe and beyond, called the “Evolution Education
   Questionnaire on Acceptance and Knowledge” (EEQ). The measurement
   instrument was translated into several European languages, in the

   In addition, in the case of theories of evolution, factuality is

   questions given that each of them can have minimal variability”.

   the acceptance of evolution was yet to be done. Possibly, the results
   published by research groups from different countries, after our data
   collection, and the growth of conservative and anti-evolutionist
   influence, mainly in Brazil, have been decisive to emphasize the need
   for this particular study.
