   Biological evolution is the supposed process by which the first cell
   evolved into the diversity of life we see today. Natural selection and
   mutations are considered its driving force; however, evolution has
   never been observed despite numerous protestations to the contrary.
   Natural selection and mutations cannot add the information necessary to
   change one kind of organism into another. And it doesn’t take a science
   degree to understand why molecules-to-man evolution is impossible.

evolution Defined: “Macro vs. Micro” evolution

   evolution is a word that is used a lot but is poorly defined.
   evolutionists themselves frequently equivocate on the term, using it to
   mean multiple things, sometimes even within the same sentence.

   “Macroevolution” is used to describe the large-scale changes believed
   to be able to turn a blob of protoplasm into a person. By contrast,
   “microevolution” is intended to describe the small-scale changes in
   populations, such as those exhibited by Darwin’s finches—the finch
   populations change beak sizes regularly in response to environmental
   pressures. However, they remain finches. No new traits or major changes
   take place.

   Since the term evolution is so strongly associated with the
   particles-to-people myth, we tend to use the word speciation to explain
   adaptation and variation within the created kinds, such as that
   exhibited by the finches.Because the small-scale changes generally lead
   to a loss of genetic information rather than a gain of new information
   needed to create new traits like arms and eyes, microevolution can
   never lead to macroevolution. evolutionists tend to use these ideas
   interchangeably. For this reason, we avoid those terms, preferring to
   speak of speciation within created kinds (which we can observe and
   verify) and molecules-to-man evolution (which is unobservable and
   unverifiable).
   History Of evolution

History of evolution: Charles Darwin and Others

   Many people believe that evolution began with Charles Darwin in 1859.
   This belief, however, is inaccurate. evolution as an idea has existed
   since at least the Greek philosophers. A Frenchman named Jean-Baptiste
   Lamarck had proposed a form of evolution in the early 1800s. In fact,
   Darwin’s grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, engraved a Latin motto on his
   coach and book plates meaning “Everything from Shells,” indicating his
   belief in evolution.

   Darwin built on past ideas and added his own wrinkle, one he borrowed
   from creationist Edward Blyth. Darwin observed that farmers could breed
   all manner of animal varieties using artificial selection. He then
   extrapolated from this that, given the millions of years his friend
   Charles Lyell proposed, whole new types of organisms could evolve
   “naturally” using Blyth’s process, hence natural selection. What Blyth
   saw as a conservative force in God’s creation meant to keep populations
   from breaking down, Darwin turned into a creative force that turned
   organisms into entirely new kinds of organisms over eons of time.

   When Darwin published his famous book, the ground had already been
   prepared for its acceptance, particularly within the church. The
   scientific community, by and large, had accepted the millions-of-years
   hypothesis of Lyell and James Hutton, and these ideas, sadly, had
   seeped into the church. Numerous leading theologians of the day, such
   as Thomas Chalmers, were advocates of the Gap Theory, which attempted
   to add millions of years into the Bible. The influence of Chalmers and
   others like him caused many in the church to unquestioningly accept
   millions of years and some to even add Darwin’s evolutionary ideas into
   the Bible.

evolutionary Thought Since Darwin

   Since Darwin’s time, evolution has become the dominant dogma in the
   sciences, even in seemingly unrelated areas. It is impossible to go to
   a secular school and not get overdosed with evolutionary teaching. The
   base model of the dogma has changed very little since Darwin.

   evolutionists still teach that man evolved from apelike creatures over
   millions of years. Other aspects of the idea have been filled in so
   that the evolutionary skeleton looks a little more complete, at least
   for public consumption. However, digging beneath the surface reveals
   things are not well in the evolutionary dogma.

   evolution became permanently immortalized in American culture in 1925
   in what was termed the “Scopes Monkey Trial” in Tennessee. Attempting
   to challenge a Tennessee state law that forbade teaching human
   evolution, the ACLU prompted a substitute teacher named John Scopes to
   admit to breaking the law, even though he later acknowledged he had
   never done so. The trial took on monumental proportions when two of the
   most famous lawyers in America, Clarence Darrow and William Jennings
   Bryan, took opposite positions. The trial ended with Scopes being
   convicted, but not before Darrow tricked Bryan into testifying and used
   him as a pincushion to mock the Bible.

   The trial was later immortalized in a Hollywood move entitled Inherit
   the Wind, which got almost every basic fact about the case wrong and
   painted biblical creationists in the worst light possible. Tennessee’s
   law was eventually repealed, and Darwin’s ideas are now dominant in the
   public school system across the nation.
   Genetic Challenge

The Genetic Challenge to Classic Darwinian evolution

   Darwin had no knowledge of genetics, even though Mendel’s
   groundbreaking work on genetics was published during his lifetime. When
   genetics made its way into mainstream science, evolutionists adapted
   Darwin’s ideas to fit the emerging study of genetics, forming what is
   called the Modern Synthesis of Darwinian evolution, or neo-Darwinism.
   Most evolutionists today are adherents of neo-Darwinism to one extent
   or another. Neo-Darwinism emphasizes four major forces: gene flow,
   genetic drift, natural selection, and mutations. From these four
   forces, neo-Darwinists believe that they can explain the diversity of
   life on earth.

   Natural selection is the primary mover in the evolutionary dogma.
   Natural selection allows organisms that are best suited to their
   environment to survive and pass on their genetics with greater
   frequency. These organisms, because they are best suited for their
   environment, produce the most offspring. Over time, the traits of these
   organisms become dominant in a population. This is where mutations come
   in.

   evolutionists regard mutations as the force that creates new variation.
   While they acknowledge that mutations almost always remove genetic
   potential, they believe that on rare occasions a mutation will occur
   that can create an entirely new trait that is beneficial in a certain
   environment. Natural selection will then increase this trait in a
   population. Given enough time, and enough beneficial mutations,
   neo-Darwinists believe that one kind of organism can turn into another
   kind of organism—a fish can become a philosopher.

How Mutations Work in Real Life

   But the observable facts do not fit evolutionists’ dogma. Natural
   selection does happen, but it works just as Blyth envisioned it did: as
   a preservative, weeding out the worst mutations to preserve the health
   of a population. Scientists acknowledge natural selection is not the
   same as evolution. Mutations likewise occur, but most if not all
   mutations described as beneficial are only beneficial in certain, often
   unusual, situations.

   Antibiotic resistant bacteria is an often-cited example of evolution in
   action by means of mutation and natural selection. Antibiotic
   resistance already existed in bacterial populations before they were
   exposed to antibiotics. When artificial selection was applied in the
   form of antibiotics, the resistant ones survived. However, if there is
   no antibiotic present, resistant bacteria represent a tiny percentage
   of the population. This is because the way they avoid the antibiotic
   also results in them having a much harder time intaking nutrients. The
   mutation is only advantageous in a very specific circumstance, yet
   detrimental in a normal environment. God even created bacteria “after
   their kind” so they will always be bacteria.

No Increase in Genetic Information

   There is no known observable process by which new genetic information
   can be added to an organism’s genetic code, let alone how that
   information could arise from random chemicals in the first place.
   Information requires an intelligent source, since it requires not only
   data but also the ability to decode that data. This alone is enough to
   refute evolution because there’s no way for a fish to become an
   amphibian without new information.
   Origin of Life

The Origin of Life in Darwinian evolution

   Any ideas about how life could have started on earth overlook one
   important rule in biology: life doesn’t, cannot, and will never come
   from non-life. Life always comes from life. That’s the law—the law of
   biogenesis, to be exact. Scientists who try to simulate the origin of
   life really show how much intelligence is required for life to begin in
   the first place.

   While Darwin himself never addressed the origin of the universe and
   rarely touched on the origin of life, both are key aspects of
   evolutionary dogma. While many evolutionists attempt to distance
   themselves from these, particularly the origin-of-life question, both
   are fundamentally necessary for evolution to be true. Since most
   evolutionists insist on a naturalistic explanation for everything, the
   origin of life and origin of the universe are both fundamental
   questions evolutionists must answer to support their dogma and a
   naturalistic worldview.

   The origin-of-life question has troubled evolutionists for decades. In
   Darwin’s day, the internal workings of the cell were completely
   unknown. It was easy to speculate about the origin of something
   regarded simply as a tiny bag of slime. However, as we learned more
   about the intiricate workings of the cell, this became much more
   difficult.

   In the 1950s, a famous experiment at the University of Chicago known as
   the Miller-Urey experiment attempted to demonstrate the naturalistic
   origin of life. In the textbooks and headlines, they are said to have
   created the building blocks of life in a test tube. What they actually
   created was a toxic soup that included amino acids, which had to be
   removed from the reaction chamber before they were destroyed in a
   second pass. The experiment also deliberately excluded oxygen, as it
   would have destroyed their results. This experiment is still cited
   today as evidence of life from non-life, likely because all attempts to
   improve on the experiment have failed to produce even the basic
   structures needed for life.

The Fossil-Record Problem for evolution

   The fossil record is regularly trotted out as containing the finest
   examples of evolutionary changes in organisms. Yet within the
   evolutionist community itself, there was a massive schism in the 1970s
   when the late Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge proposed the idea of
   punctuated equilibrium. This idea acknowledged a virtual absence of
   transitional forms in the fossil record and proposed that evolution was
   not a gradual process. Instead, it was a jerky, jumpy process that
   mostly involved stasis before great leaps of change. While less common
   today with the influence of the dynamic Gould removed, the mere fact
   that this idea gained popularity attests to the lack of transitional
   forms in the fossil record.

   evolutionists prop up their dogma by claiming the earth is millions or
   even billions of years old. The most common proof of these great ages
   is radiometric dating. It is not carbon-14 dating, despite Hollywood
   being fixated on this dating method. Carbon-14 dating would only work
   on carbon-containing materials that are “only” a few tens of thousands
   of years old. Yet carbon-14 has been found in diamonds, which are
   supposedly billions of years old. It should be long gone, but it isn’t.

   Other forms of radiometric dating include uranium-lead dating,
   potassium-argon dating, rubidium-strontium dating and so on. All are
   governed by three basic assumptions. Scientists assume they know how
   much of both the parent and daughter element existed in the rock when
   it was formed. They assume that none of either the parent or daughter
   element was added or lost during the decay process.

   Finally, they assume that the rate of decay has been constant. None of
   these assumptions can be empirically proven. In fact, creationists have
   done radiometric testing on rocks of known ages, such as those formed
   in the Mount St. Helens eruption, and found that they dated at tens of
   thousands of years old despite being formed in 1980. Radiometric dating
   does not work as a reliable indicator of the age of the earth or its
   rocks.

   Very little of what evolutionists present as evidence for their dogma
   is good science. In fact, the mere idea of naturalistic evolution is
   anti-science. If evolution were true and if a random chance process
   created the world, then that same process of chance created the human
   brain and its powers of logic. If the brain and its use of logic came
   about by chance, why trust its conclusions? To be consistent,
   evolutionists should reject their own ability to reason logically. Of
   course if they did that, they would have to reject their own dogma as
   well, compelling them to accept a creator. evolution is a self-refuting
   religion.

   The types of changes evolution requires would be expected to provide
   many examples of missing links in virtually every layer of the geologic
   record. This is not the case. The geologic record is better explained
   by the global flood and the subsequent localized catastrophes after the
   flood.
   Christian Theology

evolution’s Effects on Christian Theology

   Unfortunately, as in Darwin’s day, much of the church has accepted
   millions of years and evolution as fact, without ever considering the
   underlying assumptions or how the acceptance of these assumptions
   undermines the biblical text and the gospel.

   For example, consider what happens when you attempt to add evolution
   into the Bible. Adam and Eve are no longer the first humans, and
   original sin goes out the window. This does irreparable damage to the
   biblical redemption narrative. The Bible says that death came into the
   world because of man’s sin (Romans 5:12) and that all of creation
   labors under a curse because of sin (Romans 8:22). Scripture also says
   that Christ is the last Adam, come to redeem us from the sin brought
   into the world through the first man, Adam (1 Corinthians 15:22, 45).
   If Adam were a mythical figure, which is what evolution demands, even
   in a Christianized form, the entire parallel between the two Adams and
   the kinsman redeemer concept is destroyed. By advocating evolution,
   theistic evolutionists are undermining the very tenets of Christianity.

   Those Christians who reject evolution but accept millions of years have
   an equivalent problem. Jesus, when explaining marriage to the
   Sadducees, referred to Adam and Eve as existing from the beginning of
   creation (Mark 10:6). According to those who accept millions of years,
   Adam and Eve only existed after billions and millions of years of
   death: this makes Jesus either ignorant or a liar. Further, when God
   finished his creation he called everything very good (Genesis 1:31). In
   order for the millions of years to be true, God would have to be
   calling the fossil record, which records disease, death, violence, and
   suffering, very good. That is inconsistent with the character of God
   revealed throughout the rest of Scripture.

   God tells us in Genesis exactly how he created the world, and even the
   order of events doesn’t match the evolutionary tale. In addition, one
   of the things that drives evolution is death. But the Bible teaches
   that death was introduced into the perfect world as a result of Adam’s
   sin. When Christians try to reinterpret God’s infallible Word based on
   the ideas of fallible men, it undermines the gospel of Jesus Christ.
   Answers For evolutionists

evolution and the Flood

   Further, attempting to combine evolution or millions of years with the
   biblical text forces Christians to reject the reality of the global
   flood of Noah’s day. If the fossil record was laid down before man,
   then the flood is not necessary to bury the fossils and, in fact,
   conflicts with the existing record. Therefore, according to these
   individuals, the flood had to be local or mythical. This raises all
   manner of questions such as; why did God not just tell Noah to move or
   how did a local flood cover all the mountains and yet remain local? The
   only way to get around these questions is to torture the Hebrew text
   and the concept of biblical inerrancy.

   evolution, whether couched in Christianized language or presented in
   its natural atheistic colors, remains an utterly bankrupt and failed
   hypothesis about the origin of the universe or the diversity of life on
   earth. In no instance has cosmological, geological, or biological
   evolution been demonstrated, and the most common evidences for
   evolution all have been debunked. Attempting to add evolution to
   Christianity is both unbiblical and irrational, since evolution itself
   is not science but anti-science. Neither the Bible nor empirical
   science support its claims.

evolution Requires Faith

   For many, a belief in evolution comes from the desire to remove the
   need for God as Creator. Some would say evolution comes from what the
   evidence says to us. But evidence never speaks for itself, it’s always
   interpreted using your assumptions and starting points. And only when
   you examine the evidence through the lens of the Bible does it makes
   sense.

   evolution is rooted in the belief system of naturalism that doesn’t
   allow for anything outside the laws of nature to explain how our world
   operates. Ironically, naturalism requires the violation of several
   known laws of the universe.

     * The law of biogenesis (life only comes from life)
     * The uniformity of nature (uniformity cannot exist or be expected
       without a creator)
     * The laws of physics (the big bang requires the suspension of the
       laws of physics, nor could those laws exist without a creator)
     * The laws of probability (the fine tuning of the universe requires a
       creator)
     * The laws of logic (logic requires a logical source)
     * The laws of chemistry (the consistent properties of the elements
       require intelligence)
     * The laws of information (information can only come from an
       intelligence)

   To accept that all of these things truly operate in the world without
   God as their Creator and Organizer requires an immense amount of faith.
   While it is often used as a criticism of Christians, those who have an
   evolutionary worldview must accept all of these things by blind faith
   since there is no naturalistic explanation for the existence of these
   laws. While Christians also accept certain truths by faith, it is faith
   in the Creator and Lawgiver who provides a basis for those truths, not
   a blind faith in blind, chance processes.

Myths About evolution

     * “98% similarity” between human and chimp DNA
       This difference actually represents millions of letters of
       difference and many differences are not represented in the “98%
       similarity.” This is actually strong evidence for a common
       Designer, who used common building blocks in his design but gave
       humanity characteristics unlike any other creature he made.
     * “Ape-men”
       The pervasive ape-to-human montage and other "reconstructions" are
       just artwork based on imagination, wishful thinking, and
       presuppositional influence. All the supposed ape-men can be
       classified as either human or ape, not transitional forms.
     * Bad Design
       Some structures seem to show less-than-optimal design, and to some
       evolutionists this proves there is no creator. But a universe that
       has been cursed with degeneration for over 6,000 years won't
       maintain optimal design. The fact that we continue to survive is
       evidence of how good the original design was.
     * Vestigial Organs and Junk DNA
       evolutionists claim that humans and other animals have organs and
       DNA leftover from evolution. But these reports are often based on
       evolutionary expectations. The appendix, for example, was once
       thought vestigial, but now we know its function. Even a true loss
       of function shows a world that is in decay, which is exactly what
       the Bible says.
     * All Scientists Agree
       Even if every single person accepted an idea, that doesn’t make the
       idea correct. Many embrace evolution because they won’t allow for
       anything miraculous or supernatural. But there are a growing number
       of scientists, creationist and not, who do not find the supposed
       evidence for evolution to be valid or convincing.
     * Similarities Show Past evolutionary Connections
       Similarities in anatomy supposedly prove descent from a common
       ancestor. But structures that appear similar (homologous) often
       develop under the control of genes that are not homologous. There
       is another logical reason why things look alike—creation by an
       intelligent designer using a common blueprint.

Life-Changing Answers for evolutionists

   There are numerous anatomical structures that are clearly designed.
   Many are irreducibly complex, meaning the parts serve no benefit unless
   they all exist and are working together. There are many such examples
   of design in biology. All of these point to an intelligent Creator and
   Designer.

   So we’re left with an inescapable conclusion: there must be a powerful
   and super-wise Creator. With such a Creator, you no longer need
   billions of years. He could create everything in much less
   time—say . . . six days. This Creator gave us a clear record (the
   Bible) of how he created the world, how long it took him, how humans
   fell into sin, and how God the Son (Jesus) came to earth to save us
   from our sinful rebellion against him.

   Since we can trust the Bible’s history and science, we can also trust
   what it says about Jesus Christ, God’s Son, and why he came. Keep

​evolution

   updated: December 29, 2023

Definition

   evolution, as related to genomics, refers to the process by which
   living organisms change over time through changes in the genome. Such
   evolutionary changes result from mutations that produce genomic
   variation, giving rise to individuals whose biological functions or
   physical traits are altered. Those individuals who are best at adapting
   to their surroundings leave behind more offspring than less
   well-adapted individuals. Thus, over successive generations (in some
   cases spanning millions of years), one species may evolve to take on
   divergent functions or physical characteristics or may even evolve into
   a different species.
   evolution

Narration

   evolution. Studying the science of evolution can completely transform
   our understanding of the subject of history. evolution is, in a way,
   the history of all living organisms on Earth. And the timescale for
   appreciating that history is just so many orders of magnitude greater
   than what we can understand from the study of human history alone. It's
   actually humbling to situate human experience against that backdrop of
   millions of years of gradual change to the genome, millions of years of
   activity that took place on Earth prior to humans coming onto the
   scene.

   evolution comes from Latin ēvolūtiō (stem ēvolūtiōn- ) “unrolling a
   papyrus scroll, reading through (an author's words or a book),” a
   derivative of the verb ēvolvere “to roll out or away, unroll (a papyrus
   scroll), uncover, unwrap, unfold by using the intellect.”
   The earliest English meaning of evolution, “a movement or series of
   movements of troops or ships into battle formation,” dates from the
   early 17th century. The modern, biological sense “change in the gene
   pool of a population from generation to generation by mutation, natural
   selection, and genetic drift,” first appears in 1832 in the works of
   British geologist Charles Lyell in a discussion of some invertebrate
   sea creatures.
   Charles Darwin did not use the word evolution at all in his first
   edition of On the Origin of Species (1859), although he did use the
   verb evolved at the very end of the book. Darwin preferred descent with
   modification, because the idea of progress had no place in his theory
   or work. It was his contemporary Herbert Spencer who, embracing
   Darwin's work, popularized evolution in its biological sense and also
   extended the word into ethics, philosophy, and sociology.

     __________________________________________________________________

    1. The process by which species of organisms arise from earlier life
       forms and undergo change over time through natural selection. The
       modern understanding of the origins of species is based on the
       theories of Charles Darwin combined with a modern knowledge of
       genetics based on the work of Gregor Mendel. Darwin observed there
       is a certain amount of variation of traits or characteristics among
       the different individuals belonging to a population. Some of these
       traits confer fitness-they allow the individual organism that
       possesses them to survive in their environment better than other
       individuals who do not possess them and to leave more offspring.
       The offspring then inherit the beneficial traits, and over time the
       adaptive trait spreads through the population. In twentieth
       century, the development of the the science of genetics helped
       explain the origin of the variation of the traits between
       individual organisms and the way in which they are passed from
       generation to generation. This basic model of evolution has since
       been further refined, and the role of genetic drift and sexual
       selection in the evolution of populations has been recognized. See
       also natural selection sexual selection. See Notes at adaptation
       Darwin.
    2. A process of development and change from one state to another, as
       of the universe in its development through time.

a closer look

   Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection assumed that tiny
   adaptations occur in organisms constantly over millions of years.
   Gradually, a new species develops that is distinct from its ancestors.
   In the 1970s, however, biologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould
   proposed that evolution by natural selection may not have been such a
   smooth and consistent process. Based on fossils from around the world
   that showed the abrupt appearance of new species, Eldredge and Gould
   suggested that evolution is better described through punctuated
   equilibrium. That is, for long periods of time species remain virtually
   unchanged, not even gradually adapting. They are in equilibrium, in
   balance with the environment. But when confronted with environmental
   challenges-sudden climate change, for example-organisms adapt quite
   quickly, perhaps in only a few thousand years. These active periods are
   punctuations, after which a new equilibrium exists and species remain
   stable until the next punctuation.

Cultural definitions for evolution

   evolution
     __________________________________________________________________

   A theory first proposed in the nineteenth century by Charles Darwin,
   according to which the Earth's species have changed and diversified
   through time under the influence of natural selection. Life on Earth is
   thought to have evolved in three stages. First came chemical evolution,
   in which organic molecules (see also organic molecule) were formed.
   This was followed by the development of single cells capable of
   reproducing themselves. This stage led to the development of complex
   organisms capable of sexual reproduction. evolution is generally
   accepted as fact by scientists today, although debates continue over
   the precise mechanisms involved in the process. (See mutation,
   punctuated equilibrium, and creation science.)

Notes for evolution

   The first cell is thought to have been formed when the Earth was less
   than a billion years old.

Humans may have influenced evolution of dogs’ eye colour, researchers say

   Dark eyes are more common in domesticated dogs, possibly because we
   consider this trait more friendly

   Human preferences for a friendly face may have steered the evolution of
   canine eye colour, researchers have suggested.

   Ever since canines were domesticated, some time between 15,000 and
   50,000 years ago, humans have selected – whether consciously or not –
   particular traits in their dogs.

   Among them, it appears humans have a penchant for puppy dog eyes.
   Scientists previously found that dogs have evolved particular facial
   muscles that allow them to pull a doleful expression, triggering a
   nurturing response in humans and so giving such dogs an advantage.

   Now research suggests humans may have influenced canine eye colour,
   too. A study by scientists in Japan found that dark eyes are more
   common in domesticated dogs than their wild relatives, and that humans
   perceive dogs with dark eyes as being more friendly.

   “I speculate that lighter irises have some evolutionary advantage for
   wolves, but domestication has lost this selective pressure and darker
   eyes have emerged in some primitive dogs,” said Akitsugu Konno, the
   first author of the research, from Teikyo University of Science.

   The team say dark eyes may subsequently have been favoured by humans,
   possibly unconsciously, during domestication from wolves to dogs.

   However, Konno noted that the later development of particular breeds
   could also have influenced canine eye colour: for example, the blue
   merle coat colour seen in breeds including shelties and border collies
   is associated with blue eyes.

   Writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science, the team describe
   how they compared iris colour in 22 images of grey wolves of various
   coat colours and from different locations, and images of 81 domestic
   dogs, finding that the latter tended to have darker and more reddish
   eyes.

   The researchers then created 12 pairs of images, with one image of each
   pair showing a domestic dog with light eyes and the other showing the
   same dog with dark eyes. A selection of these pairs was shown to 76
   people who were asked to rate the dogs for various personality traits
   and how much they would like to interact with or keep the dog.

   The team found that dogs with dark eyes were rated higher for
   friendliness than light-eyed dogs and deemed more easy-going, sociable
   and dependent, and less aggressive, intelligent and mature. Similar
   results were obtained when the survey was repeated with another 66
   participants.

   “We speculate that a darker iris makes it more difficult to distinguish
   the size of the pupil and thus gives the illusion of a large pupil,
   which is associated with our perception of being more infant-like,”
   Konno said.

   The researchers add that the association of dark eyes with immaturity
   could influence humans to protect and care for such canines, although
   the study found eye colour was not itself directly related to whether
   participants wanted to interact with or keep the dog.

   “Overall, dogs with dark eyes may have evolved the trait largely as
   means to send non-threatening gaze signal to humans,” the team write.

   humans has not been found. Might epigenetics hold the answer?

   Last century, when things were a whole lot worse for gay people than
   they are today, there was a widely held notion that human homosexual
   behaviour was a choice, and that a homosexual person could change their
   ways and become heterosexual. For this reason, the occasional report of
   a “gay” gene was welcomed by many progressive people. The existence of
   such genes would show that homosexuality was not a choice but an
   inevitable consequence of development and genetics. Indeed, gay genes
   were perhaps the only example where many left-leaning people heartily
   embraced genetic determinism.

   Awkwardly, like cold fusion, reports of genes that “cause” human
   homosexuality (and many other human behaviours) have failed to stand up
   to scrutiny – there is no “gay gene” in the sense that no one has
   identified genetic markers or genes that reliably predict sexual
   orientation in humans. Moreover, since homosexuality would generally be
   reckoned to reduce reproductive output of an individual, an allele (a
   gene variant) that directly causes homosexuality is unlikely to spread
   in a population.

     Epigenetic inheritance remains a tantalising possibility

   Nonetheless, human homosexuality in both sexes is widespread, as it is
   across the animal kingdom. One study estimated that 3.2% of the
   Australian human population identifies as gay or lesbian, a frequency
   that is typical across the world. Despite the lack of genetic markers
   that are predictive of human homosexuality, the trait is highly
   heritable in the sense that siblings are more similar in their sexual
   orientation than expected by chance. However, the level of concordance
   between identical twins is surprisingly low.

   Here’s an anecdotal example. I once had a friend who was the president
   of Gay Liberation in Victoria as a young man during the 1970s. “Fred”,
   now deceased, had a prominent scar on his forehead, a legacy of being
   beaten up in a country town where he had been invited to speak about
   his cause. (The burghers of the town were waiting to pick him up at the
   station, with evil intent.) Yet Fred’s identical twin was not gay. So
   much for genetic determinism. If homosexuality was solely genetically
   determined, identical twins should have identical sexual orientation.

   The widespread occurrence of homosexuality in humans and other animals,
   together with its high heritability but unpredictable genetics and lack
   of genetic markers, is a significant biological puzzle. There are three
   leading hypotheses for the common existence of homosexuality in human
   populations, one based on kin selection, one on sexually antagonistic
   alleles, and one on epigenetic inheritance.

   Briefly, the kin selection idea is that a gene that promotes homosexual
   behaviour can spread in a population if homosexual people contribute
   significantly to the reproduction of close relatives. Although this
   idea is plausible, the lack of any genetic marker that is reliably
   associated with sexual orientation is a strong argument against it.
   Epigenetics, the misunderstood science that could shed new light on
   ageing

   The “antagonistic alleles” idea is that there are certain genes that
   are selected in different directions, that is, positively selected in
   males, but negatively selected in females and vice versa.
   Hypothetically, because no such gene has been identified, a gene that
   promotes testosterone production could be at a selective advantage in
   males if it promoted traits such as muscle development, risk taking,
   opposite-sex sexual attraction and increased sexual attractiveness to
   females. But if the same gene were expressed in the same way in females
   it might be disadvantageous for reciprocal reasons. This means that
   selection could pull in different directions in males and females,
   maintaining different gene variants in a population. By that I mean,
   gene variants that have different selective advantages in males and
   females can potentially coexist in a population because neither is
   unambiguously better. If so, sexual orientation may be more fluid than
   one might expect based on biological sex alone. (Well, “der”, I suspect
   you are now thinking, but please don’t shoot your even-handed
   messenger.)

   Finally, we have an epigenetic hypothesis. Epigenetics is the transfer
   of genetic information between generations, which is not coded in DNA.
   In most mammals, male sexual development is determined by SrY, a gene
   on the Y chromosome. SrY codes a protein that interacts with other
   genes to reverse the default development of an embryo’s gonads from an
   oestrogen-producing ovary into a testosterone-producing testis. Thus,
   the short story of mammalian sexual development is that if a foetus is
   bathed in oestrogen produced by its default ovaries, it develops a
   female body. But if it is bathed in testosterone from its newly
   converted testes, it develops as a male.

   Well, that’s a nice cut-and-dried story of genetic determinism, isn’t
   it?

   I cheerfully taught it in my first-year biology classes for more than
   two decades, in full knowledge that the story is more complex. For
   example, if an individual’s testosterone production is defective, a
   genetic male (based on their possession of a Y chromosome and SrY gene)
   will develop as a female. Indeed, such individuals may be hyper-female,
   since they do not produce or respond to testosterone, whereas genetic
   females do both.

   Even more extraordinary is a rare syndrome caused by a deficiency of
   the enzyme 5α-reductase. This enzyme converts testosterone to a more
   potent male-determining hormone. These kids, who are chromosomally
   male, are born with female-like genitalia and are often raised as
   girls. They then change to the male phenotype at puberty with its
   associated release of testosterone. Not only do male foetuses produce
   more androgens than female foetuses, they respond to it more strongly
   due to sex-specific epigenetic marks in genes that code for androgen
   receptors. Conversely, female foetuses produce less androgen and have
   reduced responsiveness to it. It is even possible for a genetically
   female foetus to have levels of circulating androgens in the male range
   but still develop as a female. So, while the primary cause of male
   bodies from female bodies is indeed SrY, other genes on the sex
   chromosomes can modify its effects.

   The epigenetic hypothesis for the widespread occurrence of human
   homosexuality is based on the possibility of epigenetic inheritance of
   adjustments to a foetus’s testosterone sensitivity. Like most other
   epigenetic marks, sex-specific epigenetic marks are established anew in
   the early embryo following fertilisation.

   Thus, most of the sex-specific epigenetic marks on genes that are
   involved in testosterone sensitivity are scrubbed off and
   re-established in a reliably sex-specific pattern well before the
   gonads become differentiated into either testes or ovaries. However,
   not all epigenetic marks are completely erased during embryo
   development, and it is therefore possible that there is some
   transgenerational transfer of epigenetic settings for testosterone
   sensitivity. This could affect sexual phenotype, sexual identity and
   sexual attraction.

   This is a potentially important idea because it may explain the strong
   tendency for twins to have similar sexual preferences, but for this
   tendency to be no stronger between identical twins than it is between
   non-identical twins. This suggests epigenetic inheritance from one or
   other parent, but not genetic inheritance. If it were solely genetic,
   we would expect identical twins to be much more likely to share their
   sexual preferences than non-identical twins.

   So, to the extent to which human homosexuality is the question,
   epigenetic inheritance remains a tantalising possibility.

evolution

   evolution

   The Washington Post / Getty

   evolution is the way living organisms change over time, driven by
   natural selection.

   A revolutionary insight put forward by Charles Darwin in On the Origin
   of Species in 1859, the concept of natural selection was also touted by
   another British naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, who had come up with
   the idea at the same time.

   The two men hit upon a mechanism for evolution: all organisms vary and
   some variations are more beneficial than others, helping individuals
   thrive and preferentially pass them on to the next generation. In other
   words, these variations are naturally selected. (Darwin later outlined
   a similar mechanism, “sexual selection” whereby variations considered
   more attractive to the opposite sex are more likely to be passed on.)

   Natural selection requires that beneficial characteristics be passed
   from one generation to the next intact. It was not clear to Darwin how
   this might happen. However, at around the same time an Augustinian monk
   called Gregor Mendel was conducting experiments that held the answer.
   In 1866, he published results from studies of inheritance in pea
   plants, marking the birth of modern genetics. His discoveries went
   unnoticed for over three decades. Not long after they were
   rediscovered, genes were identified as units arranged along the
   chromosomes inside the cell’s nucleus. And in 1937, the “modern
   synthesis” brought these ideas together, defining evolution in genetic
   terms as the “change in the frequency of an allele [gene variant]
   within a gene pool”.

   Though it was made famous by Darwin, the idea of evolution actually
   predates him. By the early 19th century, developments in geology and
   mining had revealed Earth to be inconceivably ancient. It was also
   found to have changed over time, along with the forms of life that
   lived on it. One of the first people to try to explain how new species
   formed was Erasmus Darwin, Charles’s grandfather. Another influential
   early evolutionist was the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck,
   whose “transmutation of species” theory famously argued that change
   occurs when characteristics acquired during an organism’s lifetime are
   passed on to its offspring.

   In recent years, the theory of evolution itself has evolved. The idea
   that it is entirely driven by natural selection is challenged by new
   discoveries in genetics, epigenetics and developmental biology. There
   is growing evidence that genes do not have sole control over
   development and heredity, and that organisms play active roles in their
   own fate and that of their descendants. As a result, a growing number
   of biologists believe we need to extend our ideas of how evolution
   works.

   evolution also faces a challenge from the rise of the religious
   creationist movement, which believes in the Bible’s account of the
   origins of life of Earth, and rejects evolution on this basis.

Human evolution

   The story of human evolution begins in Africa 7 million years ago

   Anthropological models

   Anthropological models based on fossils from the human evolutionary
   tree.

   P.PLAILLY/E.DAYNES/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY

   The road to humanity was a long one, and we are still exploring its
   byways. It began in Africa some 7 million years ago when our lineage
   split from that of our closest living relatives the chimpanzees. Our
   ancestors still resembled apes nearly 4 millions years later. This
   includes Lucy, a 3.2-million-year-old human ancestor discovered in
   Ethiopia, from a group called the australopiths. In some ways Lucy was
   very ape-like: she had a chimp-sized brain and long arms that suggest
   she spent a lot of time in trees. But she also walked on two legs, like
   modern humans.

   Hominins living at this time probably made simple stone tools, but our
   ancestors didn’t really begin to look and behave like us until about
   1.9 million years ago with the appearance of the genus Homo. Homo
   erectus fossils have been found in Europe and Asia, marking it out as
   the first hominin to make its way out of Africa. It produced far more
   sophisticated tools than its predecessors, and was probably also the
   first hominin to control fire. Some researchers believe it invented
   cooking, providing them with more energy to allow bigger brains to
   evolve.

   However, the anatomy of Homo erectus suggests it was incapable of
   speech. That talent most likely came with Homo heidelbergensis, which
   evolved from Homo erectus in Africa about 600,000 years ago.
   Populations of Homo heidelbergensis living in Eurasia are thought to
   have given rise to the Neanderthals in the west and an enigmatic group
   called the Denisovans in the east. And was it was considered to be our
   direct ancestor too. However, new evidence is completely rewriting this
   part of the human story.

   Until recently, the out-of-Africa paradigm had Homo sapiens evolving in
   East Africa around 150,000 years ago, becoming capable of modern
   behaviours around 60,000 years ago, and then migrating en masse to
   colonise the entire world. But new analyses of fossils, tools and DNA
   tell a different story. It looks like our species is far older – at
   least 300,000 years old – and was behaviourally sophisticated from the
   start. We did evolve in Africa but, rather than originating in one
   region, we emerged from populations across the continent in a process
   called “African multiregionalism”. Everything, from the identity of our
   last ancestor, when our species left Africa and what happened next, is
   up for revision. These are interesting times to be exploring the human
   story – no doubt, there will be more plot twists to come.

evolution of the eye

   evolution of the eye

   Linda Parton / Alamy

   They appeared in an evolutionary blink and changed the rules of life
   for ever. Before eyes, life was gentler and tamer, dominated by
   sluggish soft-bodied creatures lolling around in the sea. The invention
   of the eye ushered in a more brutal and competitive world. Vision made
   it possible for animals to become active hunters, and sparked an
   evolutionary arms race that transformed the planet.

   When did eyes evolve?

   The first eyes appeared about 541 million years ago – at the very
   beginning of the Cambrian period when complex multicellular life really
   took off – in a group of now extinct animals called trilobites which
   looked a bit like large marine woodlice. Their eyes were compound,
   similar to those of modern insects. And their appearance in the fossil
   record is strikingly sudden. Trilobite ancestors from 544 million years
   ago don’t have eyes. So what happened in that magic million years?
   Surely eyes, with their interconnected assemblage of retina, lens,
   pupil and optic nerve, are just too complex to appear all of a sudden?

   How did eyes evolve?

   Advertisement

   The complexity of the eye has long been an evolutionary battleground.
   Ever since William Paley came up with the watchmaker analogy in 1802 –
   which claimed that something as complex as a watch must have a maker –
   creationists have used it to make the “argument from design”. Eyes are
   so intricate, they say, that it stretches credibility to suggest they
   evolved through the selection and accumulation of random mutations.

   Charles Darwin was well aware of the argument. In On the Origin of
   Species he admitted that eyes were so complex that their evolution
   seemed “absurd to the highest degree”. But he went on to convincingly
   argue that it only seemed absurd. Complex eyes could have evolved from
   very simple ones by natural selection as long as each gradation was
   useful. The key to the puzzle, Darwin said, was to find eyes of
   intermediate complexity in the animal kingdom that would demonstrate a
   possible path from simple to sophisticated.

   Those intermediate forms have now been found. According to evolutionary
   biologists, it would have taken less than half a million years for the
   most rudimentary eye to evolve into a complex “camera” eye like ours.

   The first step is to evolve light-sensitive cells. This appears to be a
   trivial matter. Many single-celled organisms have eyespots made of
   light-sensitive pigments. Some can even swim towards or away from
   light. Such rudimentary light-sensing abilities confer an obvious
   survival advantage.

   The next step was for multicellular organisms to concentrate their
   light-sensitive cells into a single location. Patches of photosensitive
   cells were probably common long before the Cambrian, allowing early
   animals to detect light and sense what direction it was coming from.
   Such rudimentary visual organs are still used by jellyfish and
   flatworms and other primitive groups, and are clearly better than
   nothing.

   The first eyes in nature

   The simplest organisms with photosensitive patches are hydras –
   freshwater creatures related to jellyfish. They have no eyes but will
   contract into a ball when exposed to bright light. Hydras are
   interesting from an evolutionary perspective because their basic
   light-sensing equipment is very similar to that seen in other
   evolutionary lineages, including mammals. It is based on two types of
   protein: opsins, which change shape when light strikes them, and ion
   channels, which respond to the shape-shifting by generating an
   electrical signal. Genetic research suggests that all opsin/ion channel
   systems evolved from a common ancestor similar to hydras, pointing to a
   single evolutionary origin of all visual systems.

   The next step is to evolve a small depression containing the
   light-sensitive cells. This makes it easier to discriminate the
   direction the light is coming from and hence sense movement. The deeper
   the pit, the sharper the discrimination.

   Further improvement can then be made by narrowing the opening of the
   pit so that light enters through a small aperture, like a pinhole
   camera. With this sort of equipment it becomes possible for the retina
   to resolve images – a vast improvement on previous models. Pinhole
   camera eyes, lacking a lens and cornea, are found in the nautilus
   today.

   The final big change is to evolve a lens. This probably started out as
   a protective layer of skin that grew over the opening. But it evolved
   into an optical instrument capable of focusing light on to the retina.
   Once that happened, the effectiveness of the eye as an imaging system
   went through the roof, from about 1 per cent to 100 per cent.

   Eyes of this kind are still found in cubozoans, highly mobile and
   venomous marine predators similar to jellyfish. They have 24 eyes
   arranged in four clusters; 16 are simply light-sensitive pits, but one
   pair in each cluster is complex, with a sophisticated lens, retina,
   iris and cornea.

   Trilobites went down a slightly different route, evolving compound eyes
   with multiple lenses. But the basic sequence of events was the same.

   Trilobites weren’t the only animals to stumble across this invention,
   although they were the first. Biologists believe that eyes evolved
   independently on many, possibly hundreds, of occasions.

   And what a difference it made. In the sightless world of the Early
   Cambrian, vision was tantamount to a superpower. Trilobites became the
   first active predators, able to seek out and chase down prey like no
   animal before. Unsurprisingly, their victims counter-evolved. Just a
   few million years later, eyes were everywhere and animals were more
   active and bristling with armour. This burst of evolutionary innovation
   is what we now know as the Cambrian Explosion.

   However, sight is not universal. Of 37 phyla of multicellular animals,
   only six have evolved it. But these six – including our own phylum,
   chordates, plus arthropods and molluscs – are the most abundant,
   widespread and successful animals on the planet.

Why don’t we have eyes in the back of our heads?

   12 August 2020

   New Scientist Default Image

   Why hasn’t evolution given us eyes in the back of our head or rear-view
   mirrors?

   John Woodgate, Rayleigh, Essex, UK

   There are at least two reasons. Eyes are biologically expensive things
   to make and rear-view eyes don’t fit well into the very primitive body
   plan that mammals inherited. Even mammals for whom rear vision is a
   prime survival trait, such as rabbits, have only side-facing eyes, with
   sight to the rear being peripheral, but sufficient to provide an alert.

   Humans, and probably some other mammals, do have another adapted sense
   to compensate. In the 1960s, the world of audio was introduced to
   “dummy-head recordings”, using two microphones placed where the ears
   would be in a dummy head to capture sound. This creates a 3D stereo
   experience for listeners using headphones. One particular demonstration
   recording finished with a whisper close to the back of the head, which
   caused the listener to react as if to a severe threat.

   More nuanced experiments showed that sounds behind the head were
   noticed by a listener more than sounds to the front, especially if a
   listener was in a dark room. So our ears can compensate for the lack of
   rear-facing vision.

   You can look at it another way. Rear vision is useful only if potential
   threats are visible. During human evolution, that was most often not
   the case.

   It is also notable that spiders, which tend to have many eyes, only
   have them facing forwards.

   Jonathan Wallace, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK

   There are various aspects to this question. First, it supposes
   evolution works towards particular goals in a planned way, but that
   isn’t the case.

   Genetic mutations arise randomly and are then subject to selection
   pressures that can allow them to become more widespread within the gene
   pool if they are beneficial or eliminate them if they aren’t.

   So one answer is that if a mutation leading to a particular trait, such
   as rear-facing eyes, doesn’t happen in the first place, the trait won’t
   evolve, however advantageous it might seem.

   A second factor is that most traits, especially complex ones such as
   vision, don’t spring fully formed into a gene pool, but develop over
   generations from pre-existing traits and structures.

   In the case of vertebrate limbs, for example, we can see how an
   extraordinary variety of forms and functions have developed from the
   same basic structure.

   What we don’t see, though, is vertebrates evolving extra pairs of limbs
   such that they can have wings and arms for example. It would seem that
   it is relatively easy for an existing structure to be adapted to new
   uses, but harder to create entirely new structures.

   It may therefore be that the architecture of our central nervous system
   has simply not lent itself to the evolution of an extra pair of eyes in
   the back of our head.

   Having said this, it is evident that having the ability to spot
   potential predators creeping up behind us is likely to be beneficial.
   There are other species that have evolved this ability by moving the
   position of their eyes relative to the rest of their skull.

   Many birds have their eyes positioned towards the side of their skull,
   allowing them a very wide angle of vision and, in the case of some
   birds such as the woodcock, they are positioned so they can actually
   achieve 360-degree vision.

   There is a cost to this, though, in terms of loss of binocular vision.
   Species, such as owls, whose predatory lifestyle requires accurate
   judging of distances tend to have forward-facing eyes.

   This reflects another factor, which is that there may be costs and
   benefits to any given trait, and for it to evolve, the benefits have to
   outweigh the costs on average.

   Finally, there is often more than one potential “solution” to a given
   problem. In many species, including most primates, the answer to
   maintaining 360-degree awareness of surrounding hazards is to rely on
   many eyes.

   Social behaviour is common in the animal kingdom and one reason for
   this is that there is safety in numbers. You might be looking the wrong
   way when a leopard approaches, but if your herdmates raise the alarm
   this is as effective as having eyes in the back of your head.

Natural selection

   The process by which some organisms in a population survive and
   reproduce, while others do not, based on their bodies and behaviour

   By Michael Marshall

   Natural selection is the process by which some organisms in a
   population survive and reproduce, while others do not, based on their
   bodies and behaviour. It is one of the processes by which species
   change from generation to generation, and is a crucial element of the
   theory of evolution.

   A classic example of natural selection at work is the origin of
   giraffes’ long necks. The ancestors of modern giraffes were animals
   similar to deer or antelope, with necks of ordinary length. However,
   because the trees in their habitat were tall, those giraffes with
   slightly longer necks had an advantage over their shorter-necked
   fellows. The longer-necked giraffes reproduced more, so in the next
   generation longer necks were more common. Over many generations this
   process produced giraffes as they are today.

   This process of natural selection was first described by Charles Darwin
   in 1859 in On the Origin of Species. It helps explain how the many
   varied species on Earth could be descended from a single ancestral
   species.

   Natural selection is sometimes summed up as “survival of the fittest”.
   This is true but can be misleading. The word “fittest” does not
   necessarily refer to physical fitness. Rather, it means how well-suited
   an organism is to its environment and lifestyle. The fittest organisms
   are not necessarily the fastest or strongest: often they are the most
   cooperative.

   Natural selection can produce surprising results. It can produce more
   complex organisms, for example creating multicellular organisms from
   single-celled ones, but it can also simplify: for example, fish species
   that live in dark caves lose their eyes. Furthermore, when
   circumstances change natural selection can swiftly reverse course.

   However, natural selection has its limits. In particular, because it is
   not guided by a consciousness, it has no foresight and can lead species
   to evolve down paths that seem advantageous but actually lead to
   extinction.

   There is also more to evolution than natural selection. Species can
   change in a more undirected way by a process called genetic drift, in
   which certain genetic variants become more common despite not having
   any particular advantage. When a species is not under strong selection,
   genes can vary more freely and this sometimes leads to the emergence of
   remarkable new traits. There is also sexual selection, in which animals
   choose their potential mates not because of their actual fitness, but
   on the basis of showy ornaments like peacock’s tails or complex songs.
   Finally, many organisms have cultural behaviours such as tool use, and
   these feed back onto traditional evolutionary processes like natural
   selection.

   evolution is also chaotic, meaning that the changes it produces are not
   always predictable. This is partly because it relies on random
   mutations to produce the raw material on which natural selection can
   act. More controversially, it has been argued that natural selection
   has a kind of memory that allows it to swiftly recreate old solutions
   when they are needed.

   Nowadays there is also a new force in evolution: humans. We are
   exerting new selection pressures on many species, changing them in
   unpredictable ways.

Abstract

   Continuous records of sediment yield spanning from the late glacial
   through the Holocene to the present day provide an important
   opportunity to investigate landscape evolution over various timescales
   in response to a variety of natural and anthropogenic forcing
   mechanisms. This study investigates variations in sediment yield and
   landscape evolution in the 768 km2 watershed of Ossipee Lake, New
   Hampshire, USA. We pair subbottom sonar observations with analyses of
   lacustrine sediment cores to interpret a 12,000+ yr record of lake
   sedimentation in terms of changes in sediment yield and landscape
   evolution. Our results indicate high rates of sediment redistribution
   following deglaciation at ~14,500 to ~12,000 cal yr BP, followed by a
   period of gradually decreasing sediment yield until ~9000 cal yr BP,
   marking the termination of the most intense period of paraglacial
   landscape adjustment. From 9000 cal yr BP to 1850 CE, sediment yield is
   highly variable and reveals a slightly increasing trend that we
   attribute to a dominant hydroclimatic control on erosion driven by
   increasing effective precipitation in the region throughout the
   Holocene. Despite evidence for a highly dynamic landscape and an
   abundance of unconsolidated glacigenic surface deposits throughout the
   watershed, we interpret a modest erosional impact from anthropogenic
   land use.

INTRODUCTION

   A legacy of Pleistocene glaciations in the northeastern United States
   is a widespread, but variable mantle of sediment covering much of the
   landscape (Hitchcock, Reference Hitchcock1878; Goldthwait et al.,
   Reference Goldthwait, Goldthwait and Goldthwait1951). Following
   deglaciation, the rate at which this material has been redistributed
   has been influenced by paraglacial landscape adjustments, changing
   hydroclimatic conditions, and human activities (e.g., Bierman et al.,
   Reference Bierman, Lini, Zehfuss, Church, Davis, Southon and
   Baldwin1997; Francis and Foster, Reference Francis and Foster2001; Cook
   et al., Reference Cook, Yellen, Woodruff and Miller2015, Reference
   Cook, Snyder, Oswald and Paradis2020). Considering this redistribution
   of sediment in terms of watershed sediment yield has direct
   implications for understanding fundamental processes related to soil
   erosion, contaminant transport, reservoir life span, and the delivery
   of sediment to coastal systems. The postglacial landscape evolution of
   the northeastern United States is relevant to our understanding of
   previously glaciated landscapes throughout the world and is
   particularly germane to understanding how mountain landscapes and their
   associated geologic hazards may evolve under conditions of global
   warming and glacial recession, as is happening currently in many
   locations (Knight and Harrison, Reference Knight and Harrison2018).

   Quantifying sediment yield and its response to various forcings is
   especially challenging, given the need for measurements spanning a wide
   range of hydroclimatic conditions (e.g., Croke and Hairsine, Reference
   Croke and Hairsine2006) and the difficulty in deciphering the impacts
   of simultaneous changes in climate and human activity in the recent
   past (e.g., Huggel et al., Reference Huggel, Clague and Korup2012;
   Kasprak et al., Reference Kasprak, Magilligan, Nislow, Renshaw, Snyder
   and Dade2013; Cook et al., Reference Cook, Yellen, Woodruff and
   Miller2015). While geologic archives can capture a wide range of
   climatic conditions under circumstances minimally impacted by humans,
   many of the available archives provide only snapshots of past
   conditions. Sedimentary records from suitably located lakes and ponds
   offer the potential for long, continuous records of sediment
   accumulation, from which estimates of terrestrial sediment yield may be
   derived (e.g., Davis and Ford, Reference Davis and Ford1982; Cook et
   al., Reference Cook, Snyder, Oswald and Paradis2020). A limited number
   of studies in the northeastern United States have examined sediment
   delivery to lakes in response to terrestrial processes; however, the
   majority of existing records have focused on lakes with very small
   (mostly <lt;15 km^2) watersheds, lacked age control over the period most
   heavily impacted by humans, and revealed inconsistent patterns of
   sediment delivery over the Holocene (e.g., Brown et al., Reference
   Brown, Bierman, Lini and Southon2000, Reference Brown, Bierman, Lini,
   Davis and Southon2002; Noren et al., Reference Noren, Bierman, Steig,
   Lini and Southon2002; Parris et al., Reference Parris, Bierman, Noren,
   Prins and Lini2010). Two existing regional records from lakes with
   relatively large watersheds and recent age constraints that allow
   correlation of sedimentary events with historical hydrologic conditions
   and land-use activity span only the past 1100 (Cook et al., Reference
   Cook, Snyder, Oswald and Paradis2020) and 2100 yr (Cook et al.,
   Reference Cook, Yellen, Woodruff and Miller2015), failing to capture
   the period of most intense paraglacial landscape adjustments and the
   largest climatic changes of the Holocene.

   Given the importance of understanding landscape evolution in response
   to changing climate and human activity, and the dearth of suitable
   records, we seek to answer the question: How has the erosion and
   transport of sediment in the northeastern United States varied since
   deglaciation in response to long-term trends in climate, vegetation
   change, past floods, and anthropogenic land use? We do so using
   sediment cores collected from Ossipee Lake, New Hampshire, USA.
   Analysis of these cores is used to reconstruct the mass accumulation
   rate of clastic sediment from ~12,000 cal yr BP to 2017 CE as a proxy
   for watershed sediment yield. Regionally, Ossipee Lake has a uniquely
   large watershed with limited upstream water bodies, a remarkably simple
   lake geometry, and an abundance of unconsolidated sediment mantling its
   watershed. Collectively, these traits distinguish Ossipee Lake as an
   ideal setting for examining the integrated signal of hydroclimatic,
   ecological, and anthropogenic impacts on sediment yield operating
   within a large watershed over various timescales and we evaluate our
   results in relation to regional records of climate and environmental
   change.

STUDY AREA

   Ossipee Lake and its watershed are located in east-central New
   Hampshire, USA (Fig. 1). The 768 km^2 watershed ranges in elevation
   from 124 m at Ossipee Lake, to >gt;1200 m along summits of the Sandwich
   Range of the southeastern White Mountains. Presently, the watershed is
   dominantly forested (78% of current land cover), with only a small
   portion developed (4.5%) or in agricultural use (1%; Dewitz, Reference
   Dewitz2019). Thick surficial deposits surround Ossipee Lake and blanket
   much of the watershed, a legacy of the last glaciation and subsequent
   deglaciation (Newton, Reference Newton1974a, Reference Newton1974b).
   Regional deglaciation occurred around 14,500 cal yr BP (Ridge et al.,
   Reference Ridge, Canwell, Kelly and Kelley2001, Reference Ridge, Balco,
   Bayless, Beck, Carter, Dean, Voytek and Wei2012; Dalton et al.,
   Reference Dalton, Margold, Stokes, Tarasov, Dyke, Adams and Allard2020;
   Ridge, Reference Ridge2022); during the earliest stages of
   deglaciation, much of the low-elevation portions of the Ossipee
   watershed were occupied by a proglacial lake. The size of this lake and
   location of its outlet shifted rapidly in concert with the retreating
   ice front, with the lake surface migrating through a series of steps
   corresponding to present-day elevations of 182 m, 171 m, and 140 m,
   before the current 124 m elevation of the lake was established (Moore
   and Medalie, Reference Moore and Medalie1995). Meltwater from the
   retreating ice front deposited proglacial lake sediments, eskers, kame
   deposits, and outwash plains forming what is today the largest
   stratified drift aquifer within the state of New Hampshire (Moore and
   Medalie, Reference Moore and Medalie1995). Upland areas of the
   watershed are mantled in glacial till (Newton, Reference Newton1974a).

   Postglacial redistribution of surface materials in the Ossipee Lake
   watershed is widely evident, alluding to a dynamic landscape well
   suited to investigations of Holocene landscape evolution. Numerous
   examples of incised stream channels and gullies, alluvial fans, and
   erosional scarps formed from channel and shoreline migration visible in
   light detection and ranging (LIDAR) digital elevation models (DEMs;
   Fig. 2) illustrate the extent of postglacial sediment redistribution
   within the region. The dominantly sandy shoreline of the lake,
   prominent deltas at the mouths of the four primary tributaries entering
   Ossipee Lake (Bearcamp, Lovell, Pine, West Branch; Figs. 1–3), and
   postglacial migration of the lake outlet in response to beach processes
   and long-shore currents (Newton, Reference Newton1974b) further
   illustrate the abundance of available sediment and its ongoing
   redistribution within the watershed.

   sonar track lines, major tributaries to Ossipee Lake, and the prominent
   shallow shelf in the southeastern corner of the lake (modified from
   LeNoir, Reference LeNoir2019). The greatest depth is located at the
   northern coring site.

   Ossipee Lake has a surface area of 13 km^2, average depth of 8.5 m, and
   maximum depth of 19.5 m (Fig. 3). The lake's volume and depth aid in
   trapping sediment from inflowing streams, and its simple bowl-shaped
   geometry likely simplifies transport and depositional patterns within
   the lake. The large catchment area of the Ossipee watershed relative to
   the lake's surface area further helps concentrate the deposition of
   sediment and maximize the signal from terrestrial sediment input.

   Human occupation of the Ossipee watershed likely spans much of the
   Holocene, though regional estimates of the indigenous population in New
   England are relatively low for much of the postglacial period, with
   peaks occurring during the Middle and Late Holocene (Munoz et al.,
   Reference Munoz, Gajewski and Peros2010). Population rose during the
   Late Archaic (6–3 ka) and Late Woodland (1–0.5 ka) intervals. The
   latter peak has been attributed to the regional emergence of
   horticulture of native species and cultigens, especially maize.
   However, archaeological data suggest a minimal role for horticulture
   before the arrival of Europeans (Chilton, Reference Chilton and
   Alt2010). At the time of European arrival to the region in the
   mid-seventeenth century, the main village of the Ossipee tribe was
   located on the western shore of Ossipee Lake, with the lake and its
   tributaries serving as an important travel conduit (Price, Reference
   Price and Piotrowski2002). Euro-American settlement displaced the
   native population and resulted in widespread forest clearance, dam
   construction, and conversion of land to agriculture over the ensuing
   centuries. The town of Ossipee was incorporated in 1785 CE; population
   of the surrounding Carroll County first peaked in 1860 CE, with census
   data recording the presence of 2758 farms and 50% of the surveyed
   county being improved land (Merrill, Reference Merrill1889). The
   Industrial Revolution and western expansion of the United States in the
   late nineteenth century led to the abandonment of many New England
   farms and subsequent natural reforestation. While the present landscape
   remains dominantly forested, rural residential development throughout
   the twentieth and twenty-first centuries has led to increasing
   population, and commercial timber harvest has continued in isolated
   portions of the watershed.

METHODS

   We carried out fieldwork at Ossipee Lake during June 2017 and June
   2018. Subbottom sonar surveys were conducted using a SyQuest StrataBox
   HD single-frequency (10 kHz) instrument. Subbottom depths were
   approximated based on the known water depth and assumption of a
   constant speed of sound. Sediment cores were collected from both the
   northern (43°48.12′N, 71°9.00′W; 19.5 m water depth) and southern
   (43°47.16′N, 71°8.28′W; 17.7 m water depth) ends of the large central
   basin of the lake (Fig. 3). Short (~1 m) gravity cores were collected
   to ensure an intact sediment–water interface; transparent core tubes
   allowed field verification of undisturbed sediment overlain by clear
   water. A single ~2 m piston-percussion core was collected at the
   northern site. Two overlapping sequences of multiple 3 m drives were
   collected from the southern site using a Uwitec piston-percussion
   corer.

   Sediment cores were split lengthwise, visually described, and
   photographed before further analyses were conducted. We used an ITRAX
   (Cox Analytical Systems; Croudace et al., Reference Croudace, Rindby
   and Rothwell2006) core scanner housed in the Geosciences Department at
   the University of Massachusetts Amherst to obtain X-radiographs and
   measure bulk elemental abundances via scanning X-ray fluorescence (XRF)
   using a Mo X-ray source at 30 kV voltage and 55 mA current. Cores were
   scanned at 1.0 mm resolution with a count time of 10 s, except for the
   short surface cores, which were scanned using a 15 s count time. We
   limit our reporting of XRF results to a subset of elements that provide
   insight on terrestrial sediment input. Specifically, we report results
   for potassium, which has been shown to be a reliable indicator of
   clastic sediment input to northeastern lakes (Yellen et al., Reference
   Yellen, Woodruff, Kratz, Mabee, Morrison and Martini2014; Cook et al.,
   Reference Cook, Yellen, Woodruff and Miller2015, Reference Cook,
   Snyder, Oswald and Paradis2020), in addition to silicon and titanium.
   Silicon in lake sediment can be derived from both the input of
   terrestrial sediment and the accumulation of autochthonous silica of
   biogenic origin, with the ratio of silicon to titanium providing
   insight into variations in the relative proportion of biogenic silica
   that comprises the inorganic component of the sediment (Croudace et
   al., Reference Croudace, Rindby and Rothwell2006; Brown, Reference
   Brown, Croudace and Rothwell2015). We note that the 10 s count time
   used for our XRF analyses provides poor detection limits for silicon
   (Brown, Reference Brown, Croudace and Rothwell2015), and thus we are
   limited to qualitative interpretation of these data. Magnetic
   susceptibility was measured using a Bartington MS2E sensor at 0.5 cm
   intervals using split-core logging methodology (Nowaczyk, Reference
   Nowaczyk, Last and Smol2001). Percent loss on ignition (LOI) and dry
   bulk density (ρ[db]) were measured on 1 cm^3 subsamples removed from
   the cores at 1 cm intervals following standard procedures (Dean,
   Reference Dean1974). Continuous composite sedimentary sequences for the
   north and south coring sites were constructed by correlating the visual
   stratigraphy and LOI, magnetic susceptibility, and XRF data from
   individual cores (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, Supplementary Table 1)
   and identifying portions from individual cores that could be spliced
   together into a single continuous sequence. Composite sequences totaled
   2.31 m at the northern site and 8.63 m at the southern site.

   Age constraints for the sedimentary sequence were obtained from a
   combination of ^137Cs and ^210Pb stratigraphy and radiocarbon dating of
   nine terrestrial macrofossils and two bulk sediment samples recovered
   from the cores (Table 1). The clear correlation among cores allowed age
   control points determined from individual cores to be readily placed on
   the composite depth scale (Supplementary Table 1). Radiocarbon dates
   were determined via accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) at the National
   Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry laboratory at Woods Hole
   Oceanographic Institute in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and at Direct AMS
   in Bothell, Washington. Radiocarbon ages were calibrated to calendar
   years BP, where present corresponds to 1950 CE, utilizing the IntCal13
   calibration curve (Reimer et al., Reference Reimer, Bard, Bayliss,
   Beck, Blackwell, Ramsey and Buck2013) and the open-source R package
   CLAM (Blaauw, Reference Blaauw2010). One-centimeter-thick slices of
   sediment were dried, homogenized, and analyzed via gamma spectroscopy
   using a Canberra GL2020 R low-energy gamma detector to determine ^137Cs
   and ^210Pb activity profiles for the upper 35 cm of the southern core
   sequence. The onset (1954 CE) of detectable ^137Cs and subsequent peak
   (1963 CE) provided two additional age-control points used in the final
   construction of an age–depth model for the composite sequence. In
   addition, the open-source R package serac (Bruel and Sabatier,
   Reference Bruel and Sabatier2020) was used to evaluate the ^210Pb
   profile using both the constant rate of supply (CRS; Appleby and
   Oldfield, Reference Appleby and Oldfield1978) and constant flux
   constant sedimentation (CFCS; Krishnaswamy et al., Reference
   Krishnaswamy, Lal, Martin and Meybeck1971) models. Ultimately, the
   sedimentation rate determined via application of the CFCS model was
   used to estimate the age (1890 ±10 yr) of the first prominent
   stratigraphic horizon that could be correlated among all cores (at
   33.5 cm depth in the southern composite sequence), providing one
   additional control point for the age–depth model.

   composite core sequences, including all possible calibrated age ranges
   and their probabilities based on the 95% confidence intervals of the
   radiocarbon ages.

   We used the three control points established from the ^137Cs and ^210Pb
   stratigraphies along with 10 radiocarbon dates to construct a final
   age–depth model for the southern composite sequence. A variety of
   age–depth modeling methods were investigated, including various
   interpolation methods using “classical” techniques (Blaauw, Reference
   Blaauw2010), Bayesian methods (Bacon; Blaauw and Christen, Reference
   Blaauw and Christen2011), and incorporation of time-varying
   accumulation rates derived from variations in sediment composition
   (Minderhoud et al., Reference Minderhoud, Cohen, Toonen, Erkens and
   Hoek2016). The results of our examination of differing age–depth models
   are described in detail by LeNoir (Reference LeNoir2019) and
   demonstrate that the primary interpretation of results is not altered
   by choice of age–depth modeling technique, though all models have
   shortcomings. As described herein, we utilized the age–depth model
   derived from linear interpolation between control points defined by the
   2-sigma uncertainty in the calibrated ages calculated in the R package
   CLAM (Blaauw, Reference Blaauw2010) and note the following caveats.
   Linear interpolation in CLAM underestimates the uncertainty in the age
   of sediment at most depths, produces (potentially spurious) inflection
   points in accumulation rate at each control point, and is unable to
   account for changes in sedimentation rate between control points,
   resulting in underestimation of peak accumulation rates during
   short-duration events. Nonetheless, linear interpolation in CLAM
   reduces subjective decision making around input parameters found in
   other models, and its shortcomings are predictable and can therefore be
   taken into consideration during interpretation of results.

   We examined changes in the mass accumulation rate of clastic sediment
   (MAR[clastic]) in Ossipee Lake as a proxy for suspended sediment yield
   (SSY) from the watershed using a similar approach to Cook et al.
   (Reference Cook, Snyder, Oswald and Paradis2020). MAR[clastic] per unit
   area of lake bottom (g/cm^2/yr) was determined using the equation:
   (Eq. 1)$${\rm MA}{\rm R}_{{\rm clastic}} = {\rm SR} \times
   \displaystyle{{{\rm \rho }_{{\rm db}}( {100-{\rm LOI}} ) } \over
   {100}}$$
   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAMLCwgAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw=
   =]

   where SR is the instantaneous bulk sedimentation rate (cm/yr) defined
   by the slope of the age–depth model and ρ[db] and LOI are the dry bulk
   density (g/cm^3) and percent mass loss on ignition, respectively, at
   corresponding depths. Estimates of SSY in Mg/yr/km^2 were derived from
   MAR[clastic] using the equation:
   (Eq. 2)$${\rm SSY} = {\rm MA}{\rm R}_{{\rm clastic}} \times
   \displaystyle{{{\rm LA}} \over {{\rm CA}}}\;\times 10, \;000\;{\rm
   Mg}/{\rm \;g}/{\rm c}{\rm m}^2/{\rm k}{\rm m}^2$$
   [gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAMLCwgAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw=
   =]

   where LA and CA are the lake area and catchment area, respectively.
   Rather than using the total surface area of the lake, we based LA on
   the area of the lake below the 8 m depth contour (7.5 km^2), the area
   within which the majority of Holocene sediment infill is observed based
   on interpretation of the subbottom sonar transects (Fig. 4).

   indicated on transects 2018-3 and 2017-1. Basal contacts of Holocene
   lake fill and proglacial lake sediments are identified along with a
   prograding sand body in the southeastern corner of the lake (transect
   2017-1; modified from LeNoir, Reference LeNoir2019).

RESULTS

   Subbottom sonar results from three W-E transects and a single N-S axial
   transect reveal more than 20 m of stratified deposits beneath Ossipee
   Lake (Fig. 4). Despite poor penetration in portions of the lake, likely
   due to gas present in the sediment, continuous, nearly horizontal
   acoustic reflections can be traced across large portions of the lake
   subbottom. The most prominent feature, identifiable in all subbottom
   sections, is a transition to stronger reflections at approximately 6 m
   below lake bottom (identified by the dashed green line in Fig. 4). The
   unit above this horizon tapers toward the lake margins and is generally
   limited to areas of the lake below ~8 m water depth. This unit is
   identified as the Holocene lake fill based on sedimentary and
   chronological evidence. The unit below this, characterized by prominent
   reflections, is interpreted as late-glacial lake sediment. An
   additional depositional unit in the southeastern portion of the lake is
   visible in transect 2017-1 (Fig. 4D), bounded above by the flat,
   shallow lake bottom in this portion of the lake and bounded below by
   the stratified late-glacial sediments. This unit appears nonconforming
   with the underlying late-glacial sediments and distinct from the
   Holocene lake fill. Field observations indicated that surface sediment
   in this shallow, southeastern portion of the lake are dominantly
   composed of sand.

   The lowermost sediment recovered from the southern basin, from 8.63 m
   to 6.90 m composite depth below lake bottom, is light gray in color and
   composed of diffuse silt and clay laminae with occasional black streaks
   (Fig. 5B). Organic content is low (LOI <lt; 4.26%), ρ[db] varies from 0.82
   to 1.09 g/cm^3, and magnetic susceptibility ranges from 17.08 to
   191.24 × 10^−5 standard international units (SI) (Fig. 6). From 6.90 m
   to ~6.18 m, the organic content of the sediment progressively increases
   as ρ[db], magnetic susceptibility, and potassium content all decrease
   (Fig. 6). The depth of this transition from dense, inorganic sediment
   to lower-density, more organic-rich sediments is consistent with the
   prominent transition observed in the subbottom sonar at ~6 m below lake
   bottom, where more acoustically transparent material overlies a
   sequence of stronger reflections (Fig. 4).

   Figure 6. Core data from the southern composite sequence from Ossipee
   Lake. Analytical results span the upper 7.25 m. An additional 1.38 m of
   core was recovered and described, but not analyzed. Blue arrows
   indicate the position of radiocarbon dates; green arrows indicate
   control points derived from ^137Cs and ^210Pb profiles. Event layers
   (tan bands) are identified as intervals of decreased organic content
   (high LOI) and increased elevated minerogenic content (elevated ρ[db],
   magnetic susceptibility, and potassium). The portion shaded blue is
   interpreted as late-glacial deposits (modified from LeNoir, Reference
   LeNoir2019).

   The upper ~6.18 m of the southern composite core and the entire 2.31 m
   northern core sequence are composed primarily of dark brown, moderately
   organic (15–25% LOI), fine-grained (silty) sediment with a ρ[db]
   ranging from 0.17 to 0.46 g/cm^3 and magnetic susceptibility values
   ranging from 1.93 to 64.21 × 10^−5 SI (Figs. 5A and 6). Throughout the
   record, silicon and titanium covary and are strongly correlated (r
   ^2 = 0.82; Supplementary Fig. 3). The abundance of both elements
   broadly follows a similar pattern to LOI, magnetic susceptibility, and
   potassium (Fig. 6, Supplementary Fig. 3) and generally decrease from
   the earliest to latest periods of the record. The ratio of silicon to
   titanium decreases slightly over the course of the record, though low
   abundances of silicon above ~2.6 m were near or below the detection
   limit for the XRF instrument (as evident from occasional zero values
   for peak area counts) and likely result in spuriously low Si:Ti values
   for the portion of the record above 2.6 m.

   Dispersed intervals of lighter-brown sediment occur throughout the
   upper 6.18 m portion of the southern core. These intervals are enriched
   in clastic (minerogenic) sediment, as evident from a decrease in
   organic content (LOI excursions are 5–10% below that of underlying
   sediment) and increases in density, magnetic susceptibility, and
   potassium content (Figs. 5 and 6). These units are further
   characterized by sharp basal contacts that result in rapid excursions
   of proxy measurements that gradually return toward prior values,
   indicating compositional grading. We term these intervals “event
   deposits.” A total of 19 event deposits were identified in the southern
   composite sequence (Fig. 6). The uppermost event deposit, beginning at
   33.5 cm depth in the southern core and pictured in Figure 5A, is
   correlative among all cores we collected at both the southern and
   northern sites, also correlative are five underlying event deposits
   within the overlapping portion of the northern and southern records
   (LeNoir, Reference LeNoir2019; Supplementary Fig. 2). This uppermost
   event deposit was previously identified in multiple Ossipee Lake cores
   collected by Perello (Reference Perello2015), further demonstrating its
   widespread continuity. While we did not perform particle-size analysis,
   data from Perello (Reference Perello2015) indicate a slight decrease in
   median particle size from ~18 μm to 12 μm (dominated by an increase in
   clay content) at the base of the unit, followed by a gradual, but
   highly variable return above. Correlation of the event layers across
   the deep basin of the lake along with the continuous, parallel nature
   of reflections in the subbottom sonar data suggest widespread
   continuity of the sedimentary sequence in the central basin of Ossipee
   Lake.

   The combined results of the ^137Cs and ^210Pb stratigraphy and 10 ^14C
   ages from the southern composite sequence constrain the age–depth
   relationship of the sediment from ~12,000 cal yr BP to the collection
   date of the cores in 2017 CE (Fig. 7). The onset and subsequent peak of
   detectable ^137Cs at 14.5 cm and 11.5 cm, respectively, are in close
   agreement with the estimated ages of the sediment determined from both
   CRS and CFCS models of ^210Pb accumulation (Fig. 7). Below 25 cm, the
   CRS and CFCS age models diverge considerably. While the constant
   accumulation rate of the CFCS model is likely unrealistic, the marked
   decrease in accumulation rate below 25 cm implied by the CRS model is
   inconsistent with the core stratigraphy, which includes a prominent
   event deposit beginning at 30 cm in core 17-1 (composite depth of
   33.5 cm; Fig. 5A). We suspect that the most likely origin of the event
   deposit was increased deposition of clastic sediment, such that an age
   model requiring reduced accumulation through this interval is
   unrealistic. Consequently, we estimated the basal age of this event
   deposit from the CFCS age model as 1890 CE (acknowledging that the
   actual timing may be even younger) and incorporated this point in the
   age–depth model of the composite sequence. Over the 6.8 m interval of
   the composite sequence bracketed by age constraints (11,810 ± 210 cal
   yr BP to 2017 CE), the average linear accumulation rate is 0.06 cm/yr,
   with increased rates occurring after ~4000 cal yr BP and after ~1900
   CE.

   The accumulation rate of clastic sediment (MAR[clastic]; Fig. 8) varies
   throughout the record in accordance with changes in the slope of the
   age–depth model (Fig. 7) and variations in the density (ρ[db]) and
   composition (% LOI) of the sediment (Fig. 6). Given evidence in the
   subbottom sonar data for the accumulation of at least 15 m of sediment
   between deglaciation (circa 14,500 cal yr BP; Ridge et al., Reference
   Ridge, Canwell, Kelly and Kelley2001, Reference Ridge, Balco, Bayless,
   Beck, Carter, Dean, Voytek and Wei2012; Dalton et al., Reference
   Dalton, Margold, Stokes, Tarasov, Dyke, Adams and Allard2020; Ridge,
   Reference Ridge2022) and the transition to Holocene lake deposits,
   accumulation rates must have been at least 0.6 cm/yr from 14,500 to
   12,000 cal yr BP, yielding MAR[clastic] values higher than anything
   observed during the Holocene. From 11,810 to 9,000 cal yr BP
   MAR[clastic] decreases from ~0.16 g/cm^2/yr to 0.07 g/cm^2/yr in
   response to a decrease in the input of clastic sediment evident from
   the increasing LOI over this interval. From ~9000 cal yr BP to 1890 CE,
   MAR[clastic] varies widely from 0.07 g/cm^2/yr to 0.28 g/cm^2/yr, with
   the highest rates associated with distinct event deposits. Average
   MAR[clastic] is 0.014 g/cm^2/yr, yielding an estimated SSY from the
   watershed of 1.4 Mg/yr/km^2. A slightly increasing trend in
   MAR[clastic]of 0.002 g/cm^2/1000 yr is evident over this interval (r
   ^2 = 0.24, P value = 0.18; Fig. 8). The highest calculated MAR[clastic]
   values are observed after 1850 CE and are dominated by the presence of
   the prominent event deposit at 33.5 cm composite depth (Fig. 5A). Peak
   MAR[clastic] is 0.072 g/cm^2/yr and averages 0.035 g/cm^2/yr from 1850
   to 2017 CE, corresponding to a watershed SSY of 7.2 Mg/yr/km2 and 3.5
   Mg/yr/km^2, respectively. While MAR[clastic] since 1850 CE appears
   anomalous compared with the rest of the record, we note that this is
   the only portion of the record with centennial-scale age control. Given
   that the uppermost event deposit is unremarkable in terms of its
   density, LOI, or other indicators of composition, it is likely that
   actual peaks in MAR[clastic] in the earlier portion of the record would
   equal or exceed the values observed after1850 CE if deposition times
   could be constrained over similarly short intervals in the past.

   of the record highlights the portion of the record beyond the

   model is assumed to be the same as the section above it. Elevated
   MAR[clastic] in this portion of the record is a function of denser
   sediment (modified from LeNoir, Reference LeNoir2019).

DISCUSSION

   Our radiocarbon chronology indicates that the southern composite core
   sequence from Ossipee Lake spans the entire Holocene and includes
   ~1.7 m of clastic-rich gray sediment that we interpret to be late
   glacial in origin (Figs. 5 and 6). This allows us to consider
   paraglacial landscape evolution, as indicated by variability in the
   patterns of MAR[clastic] (Fig. 8), during the entire Holocene and
   through the period of Euro-American land-use change. Strong covariance
   among LOI, magnetic susceptibility, potassium, silicon, and titanium
   (Fig 6; Supplementary Fig. 3) supports our interpretation of variations
   in MAR[clastic] as primarily reflecting changes in terrestrial sediment
   input. However, we acknowledge that interpreting terrestrial processes
   from limited cores is fraught with uncertainty (e.g., Davis and Ford,
   Reference Davis and Ford1982). Nonetheless, there are several lines of
   evidence supporting the interpretation of our Ossipee Lake sequence in
   terms of landscape evolution. First, the lateral continuity of strata
   identified in the subbottom data (Fig. 4) and between our northern and
   southern core sites (LeNoir, Reference LeNoir2019; Supplementary Figs.
   1 and 2) suggests that depositional patterns within the deep basin are
   spatially consistent. Second, the relatively large size of Ossipee Lake
   and the position of our coring sites away from active deltas lead us to
   believe that we are sampling fine-grained sediment delivered primarily
   in suspension by the inflowing rivers. Delivery of sediment to these
   distal locations is likely dominated by prevailing westerly winds and
   flow of water from tributaries on the western side of the lake to the
   outlet in the eastern corner of the lake. This is in contrast to more
   marginal locations in the lake subject to slope processes and more
   sensitive to delta migration. Finally, subbottom sonar data reveal that
   the present-day bathymetry characterized by a broad, flat central basin
   mimics the underlying surface, marking the boundary between
   late-glacial and Holocene deposits, which are nearly constant in
   thickness in the central portion of the lake (Fig. 4). Consequently,
   Holocene infilling of the lake from a maximum water depth of ~25 m to
   the present 19.5 m water depth is unlikely to have resulted in widely
   shifting depocenters or trapping efficiencies. While we cannot
   definitively rule out the possible influence of long-term delta
   progradation on MAR[clastic], we emphasize the distal setting of our
   coring sites and the fact that the package of Holocene sediment visible
   in the subbottom data reveals no apparent thinning to the south or east
   as might be expected if proximity to primary deltas played a major role
   in determining accumulation rates. Consequently, the discussion that
   follows is based on the assumption that changes in MAR[clastic]
   predominantly reflect changes in the terrestrial suspended sediment
   delivered to Ossipee Lake from its watershed.

Late-glacial landscape evolution

   The initial period of elevated MAR[clastic] followed by the transition
   from dominantly minerogenic to more organic-rich sediment and
   accompanying decline in MAR[clastic] from the earliest part of our
   record to ~9200 ± 200 cal yr BP (Fig. 9) reflects the most pronounced
   interval of paraglacial landscape adjustment in the Ossipee watershed.
   The thickness of the pre-Holocene deposits evident in our subbottom
   data (Fig. 4) necessitate a >gt;0.6 cm/yr linear sedimentation rate over
   some portion of 14,500 to 12,000 cal yr BP, as constrained by our
   lowermost radiocarbon date and the timing of regional deglaciation.
   This rate is roughly an order of magnitude higher than the mean
   sedimentation rate over the Holocene. Extremely high accumulation rates
   in proglacial settings are common (Desloges and Gilbert, Reference
   Desloges and Gilbert1991; Gilbert and Desloges, Reference Gilbert and
   Desloges1992) and are consistent with readily available surface
   deposits on the freshly deglaciated landscape, abundant meltwater for
   transporting sediment, and a lack of vegetation to help stabilize
   surface deposits. Consequently, it is likely that much of the
   pre-Holocene sediments were deposited in a proglacial setting,
   immediately following ice retreat.

   and Southon2002; Noren et al., Reference Noren, Bierman, Steig, Lini
   and Southon2002; Parris et al., Reference Parris, Bierman, Noren, Prins
   and Lini2010), alluvial fans (Jennings et al., Reference Jennings,
   Bierman and Southon2003), and floodplains (Lombardi et al., Reference
   Lombardi, Davis, Stinchcomb, Munoz, Stewart and Therrell2020); (D)
   regional climate reconstructions (Shuman and Marsicek, Reference Shuman

   vegetation history (Shuman et al., Reference Shuman, Newby, Donnelly,
   Tarbox and Webb2005; figure modified from LeNoir, Reference
   LeNoir2019).

   The continuation of elevated MAR[clastic] even after the regional ice
   margin had retreated beyond the watershed boundary reflects ongoing
   paraglacial adjustments, likely including a pronounced period of stream
   incision driven by a combination of lake-level reduction, vegetation
   establishment, and glacial isostatic adjustments. Evidence for a higher
   lake level early in the deglaciation of the Ossipee Valley is provided
   by elevated shoreline features and paleo-drainage channels near the
   present lake outlet (Newton, Reference Newton1974a, Reference
   Newton1974b; Fig. 2). We see no sedimentological evidence of a
   lake-level reduction event within the core sequence that we collected
   and surmise that paleolake drainage likely occurred shortly after
   deglaciation (ca. 14,500 cal yr BP; Ridge et al., Reference Ridge,
   Balco, Bayless, Beck, Carter, Dean, Voytek and Wei2012) and no later
   than 11,810 ± 210 cal yr BP, the age of our lowest radiocarbon date.
   The Saco River valley, the next major drainage to the north of Ossipee
   Lake, was occupied by a series of small glacial lakes collectively
   referred to as Lake Pigwacket (Thompson, Reference Thompson1999),
   thought to have drained between 12,170 and 11,630 cal yr BP (Shuman et
   al., Reference Shuman, Newby, Donnelly, Tarbox and Webb2005). Falling
   lake level of an enlarged postglacial Ossipee Lake would not have
   isolated the lake basin from the dominant drainage networks supplying
   sediment to the lake. In contrast, lake-level reduction would have
   decreased the regional base level, initiated the widespread fluvial
   incision and gullying prevalent throughout the watershed (Fig. 2), and
   consequently increased sediment delivery to the lake, as evident from
   elevated MAR[clastic] in Figures 8 and 9. Pollen data from Echo Lake,
   located 30 km north of Ossipee Lake, are dominated by spruce (Picea)
   before 13,000 cal yr BP, transitioning through boreal taxa such as
   alder (Alnus), fir (Abies), and birch (Betula), before becoming
   dominated by haploxylon pine and oak (Quercus) by 11,000 cal yr BP
   (Shuman et al., Reference Shuman, Newby, Donnelly, Tarbox and Webb2005;
   Fig. 9E). These data reveal the establishment and evolution of the
   regional forest cover, which would have helped stabilize hillslopes,
   strengthen stream banks, and promote a transition from braided to
   meandering planforms as stream channels incised to the base level of
   the modern lake (Newton, Reference Newton1974a, Reference Newton1974b;
   Moore and Medalie, Reference Moore and Medalie1995; Fig. 2). In
   addition, differential rebound of 0.9 m/km resulting from retreat of
   the Laurentide Ice Sheet (Hooke and Ridge, Reference Hooke and
   Ridge2016) would have steepened the gradients of south-flowing streams,
   including the Bearcamp River, the largest tributary to Ossipee Lake,
   which drains the highest elevation and steepest portions of the
   watershed. Therefore, lake-level reduction, vegetation establishment,
   and isostatic adjustments may have all contributed to fluvial incision.
   The decrease in MAR[clastic] beginning ~12,000 cal yr BP (Figs. 8 and
   9) suggests that channel profiles may have begun stabilizing by this
   time, a pattern that is consistent with a period of most active fluvial
   incision in the earliest Holocene observed in the Missisquoi River
   valley in northern Vermont (Brakenridge et al., Reference Brakenridge,
   Thomas, Conkey and Schiferle1988) and the Connecticut River valley in
   southern New England (Schenck, Reference Schenck2018).

Early Holocene landscape changes

   We interpret the interval of decreasing MAR[clastic] from ~12,000 to
   9000 cal yr BP (Figs. 8A and 9A) as reflecting the waning influence of
   the prior glacial conditioning of the landscape. During this interval,
   stream channel profiles likely approached equilibrium with the base
   level defined by the modern elevation of Ossipee Lake, the most readily
   erodible surface deposits were being exhausted, and the regional
   vegetation transitioned from boreal taxa to a forest dominated by oak
   (Quercus), beech (Fagus), birch (Betula), and hemlock (Tsuga) that
   persisted through the remainder of the Holocene (Shuman et al.,
   Reference Shuman, Newby, Donnelly, Tarbox and Webb2005; Fig. 9E). Our
   inferred timing for stabilization of the landscape surrounding Ossipee
   Lake, ~9200 ± 200 cal yr BP, aligns with the establishment of maximum
   vegetation coverage within the Mirror Lake, New Hampshire, watershed
   around 9500 to 9000 cal yr BP (Likens and Davis, Reference Likens and
   Davis1975). The >gt;5 ka time interval from deglaciation to apparent
   landscape stabilization around 9200 cal yr BP is consistent with the
   extended timescales of paraglacial sediment reworking demonstrated for
   glaciated British Columbia river basins (Church and Slaymaker,
   Reference Church and Slaymaker1989). The shape of the Ossipee Lake
   MAR[clastic] curve during this interval is consistent with an
   exhaustion model of paraglacial landscape evolution (Ballantyne,
   Reference Ballantyne2002), in which the supply of easily mobilized
   sediment decreases as the landscape stabilizes. However, lacking the
   detailed age control within this interval needed to adequately
   constrain short-duration variations in sediment yield, we cannot rule
   out an evolution dominated by waves of erosion, as suggested by Church
   and Ryder (Reference Church and Ryder1972). Notably, the variable
   MAR[clastic] pattern and episodic occurrence of event deposits
   throughout the Holocene (Figs. 8A and 9A) suggest ongoing reworking of
   glaciogenic deposits throughout the study period.

Middle through Late Holocene landscape evolution

   The Ossipee Lake record of MAR[clastic] from ~9000 cal yr BP to ~1850
   CE is highly variable, but contains a slight trend toward increasing
   MAR[clastic] (Figs. 8A and 9A). Interestingly, the lowest values of
   MAR[clastic] during the entire record are observed around ~9000 cal yr
   BP, corresponding to a period of increased fire activity in southern
   New England during what was broadly the warmest and driest interval of
   the Holocene (Oswald et al., Reference Oswald, Foster, Shuman, Chilton,
   Doucette and Duranleau2020). While we cannot rule out short-duration
   increases in erosion and subsequent lake sedimentation in response to
   individual wildfires, the occurrence of the lowest MAR[clastic] values
   during the period of greatest regional fire activity suggests that on
   centennial or longer timescales, fire frequency is not a primary driver
   of erosion rates. In general, variations in MAR[clastic] reflect the
   combined influence of the sedimentation rate defined by the slope of
   the age–depth model and variations in the composition of the sediment.
   Though discrete peaks in MAR[clastic] are associated with the
   occurrence of event deposits (Fig. 9A) characterized by enriched
   minerogenic content (Fig. 9B), variations in the timing and frequency
   of event deposits are independent of millennial-scale changes in
   MAR[clastic] and the long-term increasing trend in MAR[clastic].

   To further explore the origins of millennial-scale changes in
   MAR[clastic], we compiled existing Holocene-length records of
   terrestrial sedimentation in the northeastern United States (Fig. 9C)
   from lakes (Brown et al., Reference Brown, Bierman, Lini, Davis and
   Southon2002; Noren et al., Reference Noren, Bierman, Steig, Lini and
   Southon2002; Parris et al., Reference Parris, Bierman, Noren, Prins and
   Lini2010), alluvial fans (Jennings et al., Reference Jennings, Bierman
   and Southon2003), and floodplains (Lombardi et al., Reference Lombardi,
   Davis, Stinchcomb, Munoz, Stewart and Therrell2020). Though these
   records reveal limited internal consistency, we note that the apparent
   periods of elevated terrestrial sediment redistribution in the regional
   records centered around ~6500 cal yr BP and ~2500 cal yr BP and
   separated by a multimillennial period of reduced activity are generally
   consistent with the pattern of MAR[clastic] in Ossipee Lake. In
   contrast, the long-term trend of increasing MAR[clastic] at Ossipee
   Lake is not observed in other regional records of terrestrial
   sedimentation. Both increasing MAR[clastic] over the Holocene and the
   episodic occurrence of event deposits (Figs. 8 and 9A) are contrary to
   simple exhaustion models of paraglacial sedimentation (e.g.,
   Ballantyne, Reference Ballantyne2002) and instead reveal persistent or
   intermittent reworking of the landscape throughout the Holocene, as was
   observed in the Scottish Highlands by Ballantyne (Reference
   Ballantyne2008).

   While the increasing trend in MAR[clastic] over the Middle and Late
   Holocene is weak, the possibility that sediment export from the
   watershed was increasing, or even remaining constant, warrants further
   exploration, as sediment availability in this paraglacial landscape
   should theoretically have been decreasing (e.g., Ballantyne, Reference
   Ballantyne2002). An increase in biogenic silica production within the
   lake or its preservation in sediment over the course of the Holocene
   would impact our LOI-based determinations of the inorganic fraction of
   the sediment and subsequent calculations of MAR[clastic], yielding a
   spurious trend toward increasing MAR[clastic] over the same interval.
   However, strong covariance of silicon and other indicators of
   terrestrial sediment (Fig. 6, Supplementary Fig. 3) suggests that
   variations in the inorganic fraction of the sediment in Ossipee Lake
   are dominated by changes in terrestrial sediment input. Furthermore, a
   gradual decrease in Si:Ti over the Holocene is suggested by our XRF
   data, though we emphasize the qualitative nature of these results
   (Supplementary Fig. 3). This pattern could result from decreasing
   production of biogenic silica in the lake, decreased preservation in
   the sediment, or dilution of biogenic silica by increased input of
   silicon from terrestrial sources (Conley and Schelske, Reference
   Conley, Schelske, Smol, Birks, Last, Bradley and Alverson2002). All of
   these possibilities are consistent with the observed increase in
   MAR[clastic] resulting from increased input of clastic sediment from
   the watershed rather than any increase in the amount of biogenic silica
   in the sediment.

   Assuming that the apparent increasing trend in MAR[clastic] over the
   Middle and Late Holocene truly reflects changing delivery of sediment
   from the watershed, we explore several plausible mechanisms capable of
   driving changes in sediment yield from the surrounding landscape.
   Regional pollen records (Shuman et al., Reference Shuman, Newby,
   Donnelly, Tarbox and Webb2005; Oswald et al., Reference Oswald, Foster,
   Shuman, Chilton, Doucette and Duranleau2020; Fig. 9E) reveal changes in
   vegetation throughout the Holocene; however, we see no obvious trend in
   vegetation that might lead to increasing sediment availability and a
   subsequent increase in MAR[clastic] in Ossipee Lake. The long history
   of human habitation in the Ossipee region and the potential for human
   modification of the landscape to have produced changes in sediment
   yield over at least the past several millennia (e.g., Dearing and
   Jones, Reference Dearing and Jones2003) provide another possible
   mechanism to explain the long-term trend in MAR[clasti][c]. However,
   indigenous populations in the region reached maxima during the Late
   Archaic (5000–3000 cal yr BP) and Middle–Late Woodland (1500–500 cal yr
   BP) periods (Munoz et al., Reference Munoz, Gajewski and Peros2010),
   which is inconsistent with the timing of peak MAR[clastic] in Ossipee
   Lake. An additional mechanism that could account for the long-term
   increase in MAR[clastic] is glacial isostatic adjustments affecting
   river gradients, base level, and/or the position of drainage divides. A
   forebulge would have existed 150–200 km south of the Laurentide Ice
   Sheet margin (Hooke et al., Reference Hooke, Hanson, Belknap and
   Kelley2017) and migrated north as ice retreated (Hooke and Ridge,
   Reference Hooke and Ridge2016). In Maine, the forebulge migrated from
   the coast to the Moosehead Lake region between 12,200 and 9500 cal yr
   BP at a rate of ~67 m/yr (Balco et al., Reference Balco, Belknap and
   Kelley1998). Combining this knowledge with constraints on the timing of
   ice margin positions in the vicinity of Ossipee Lake (Ridge et al.,
   Reference Ridge, Canwell, Kelly and Kelley2001, Reference Ridge, Balco,
   Bayless, Beck, Carter, Dean, Voytek and Wei2012; Dalton et al.,
   Reference Dalton, Margold, Stokes, Tarasov, Dyke, Adams and
   Allard2020), the forebulge likely migrated through the region before
   9000 cal yr BP, limiting the potential impact of isostatic adjustments
   on subsequent sediment delivery.

   Finally, we hypothesize that the most likely origin of any long-term
   increase in MAR[clastic] is the concomitant long-term increase in
   effective precipitation that occurred during the Holocene in this
   region (Shuman and Marsicek, Reference Shuman and Marsicek2016; Fig.
   9D). This relationship suggests that moisture balance serves as an
   important control on long-term watershed erosion rates and is
   consistent with other regional observations relating differences in the
   sediment yield from individual hydrologic events (Yellen et al.,
   Reference Yellen, Woodruff, Cook and Newton2016) and centennial-scale
   variability in erosion (Cook et al., Reference Cook, Yellen, Woodruff
   and Miller2015) to changes in underlying moisture balance. Such an
   increase in sediment yield necessitates the continued availability of
   easily reworked sediment (evident from the abundance of glacigenic
   deposits blanketing the watershed) and is consistent with Church and
   Slaymaker's (Reference Church and Slaymaker1989) observation that
   rivers in British Columbia are still responding to the last glaciation.

Historic-era land-use impacts and the origin of event deposits

   MAR[clastic] increases abruptly at ~1890 CE, with the highest
   accumulation rates of the entire record observed within the last
   century and a half (Fig. 8). The inferred SSY peak of 7.2 Mg/yr/km^2
   and 1850–2017 CE mean of 3.5 Mg/yr/km^2 nonetheless remain low relative
   to some rates proposed for other forested watersheds in the eastern
   United States (Patric et al., Reference Patric, Evans and Helvey1984).
   And while the recent increase in sediment yield might be expected based
   on the history of Euro-American settlement and land-use change in the
   region, and is consistent with human impacts in other regions (e.g.,
   Davis, Reference Davis1976; Dearing et al., Reference Dearing,
   Håkansson, Liedberg-Jönsson, Persson, Skansjö, Widholm and
   El-Daoushy1987; Heathcote et al., Reference Heathcote, Filstrup and
   Downing2013), our attribution of the increase in MAR[clastic] in
   Ossipee Lake to human land-use change must be tempered. First, our
   age–depth model provides limited resolution for constraining
   calculations of MAR[clastic], and the abrupt increase in MAR[clastic]
   is partially an artifact of an inflection point in the age–depth model
   at the base of the uppermost event deposit. Nonetheless, the event
   deposit is characterized by increased clastic content and increased
   bulk density, such that an increase in MAR[clastic] would exist even if
   the sedimentation rate (SR) remained constant throughout this interval.
   However, the anomalous nature of recent MAR[clastic] would be less
   extreme relative to earlier event deposits if age control was
   continuously well resolved over the entire record.

   A second important consideration when interpreting the recent increase
   in MAR[clastic] is the origin of the uppermost event deposit, the most
   prominent stratigraphic feature of the past 500 yr (Figs. 5 and 9A), as
   well as other event deposits throughout the record. We assigned an age
   of 1890 ± 10 CE to the base of this event, based on interpretation of
   our ^210Pb and ^137Cs profiles. If the increase in clastic content
   defining this feature was a consequence of Euro-American land-use
   change increasing sediment delivery to the lake, then the timing
   appears several decades late relative to the 1860 CE maximum in Carroll
   County population and associated agricultural activity (Merrill,
   Reference Merrill1889). Uncertainty in our age–depth model could
   facilitate shifting the onset of this event layer earlier. However,
   doing so would result in a decrease in the calculated sedimentation
   rate between the base of the event layer and the first observed fallout
   of ^137Cs in 1954 relative to the sedimentation rate between 1954 and
   the core top; an outcome deemed implausible given the pattern of
   clastic deposition over these intervals. Furthermore, the abrupt nature
   of the basal contact of the event deposit (Figs. 5 and 9B) suggests a
   near instantaneous transition in sedimentation; a pattern that is
   inconsistent with a gradual increase in deforestation and agricultural
   land use and contrasts with existing records of sedimentation that show
   a gradual increase in clastic input in response to human land-use
   change (e.g., Davis, Reference Davis1976; Dearing et al., Reference
   Dearing, Håkansson, Liedberg-Jönsson, Persson, Skansjö, Widholm and
   El-Daoushy1987; Francis and Foster, Reference Francis and Foster2001;
   Heathcote et al., Reference Heathcote, Filstrup and Downing2013) The
   abrupt nature of this and other event deposits suggests possible
   deposition from a sediment gravity flow (e.g., Gani, Reference
   Gani2004), originating either subaqueously or triggered by events in
   the watershed. However, the fine particle size and absence of textural
   grading within the uppermost event deposit as reported by Perello
   (Reference Perello2015) is inconsistent with most deposits resulting
   from density flows (Gani, Reference Gani2004). In contrast, the
   compositional grading from highly clastic to increasingly organic-rich
   sediment observed in all event deposits (Fig. 6) is similar to deposits
   observed in Amherst Lake, Vermont (Cook et al., Reference Cook, Yellen,
   Woodruff and Miller2015). In that setting, event deposits were linked
   to periods of elevated input of clastic sediment from the watershed
   initiated by extreme floods and followed by a period of decreasing
   clastic input as the landscape gradually recovered from the initial
   disturbance (Cook et al., Reference Cook, Yellen, Woodruff and
   Miller2015). Cook et al. (Reference Cook, Yellen, Woodruff and
   Miller2015, Reference Cook, Snyder, Oswald and Paradis2020) were able
   to correlate distinct event deposits to landscape disturbances related
   to historical floods in Vermont and Maine, respectively. In contrast,
   we were unable to link the uppermost event deposit in Ossipee Lake to
   any known historical flood event or other landscape disturbance.
   Indeed, with only one event deposit having occurred within last 500 yr
   in Ossipee Lake, we found no clear signature of any historical flood
   events, forest fires, or other known disturbances in the record. While
   the origin of the event deposits remains enigmatic, we hypothesize that
   they reflect abrupt increases in erosion caused by the most extreme
   hydrologic events triggering landslides in the uplands and/or avulsions
   and other adjustments in the fluvial network closer to the lake and/or
   the stochastic interaction of a laterally migrating stream channel
   occasionally intersecting a new repository of erodible sediment.

   Overall, the infrequent occurrence of event deposits, averaging only 1
   per ~500 yr over the Holocene, and the apparently modest SSY over the
   past century portray a landscape only moderately sensitive to
   disturbances. In contrast to other watersheds, where both distinct
   floods (Cook et al., Reference Cook, Yellen, Woodruff and Miller2015,
   Reference Cook, Snyder, Oswald and Paradis2020) and changes in land use
   (Cook et al., Reference Cook, Snyder, Oswald and Paradis2020) are
   clearly recorded in lacustrine archives, Ossipee Lake and its watershed
   are considerably larger than those focused on by other studies in the
   region. Sediment entering a larger waterbody may be distributed over a
   larger area, potentially muting the depositional signature. The large
   area of the Ossipee watershed also provides more opportunity for
   trapping and storage of sediment in lakes, wetlands, and floodplains
   and behind dams upstream of the lake. The Amherst Lake and Little
   Kennebago Lake watersheds studied by Cook et al. (Reference Cook,
   Yellen, Woodruff and Miller2015, Reference Cook, Snyder, Oswald and
   Paradis2020), respectively, were both characterized by steeper average
   slopes and fewer upstream water bodies likely to trap fine sediment
   relative to the Ossipee watershed. Despite these factors, Euro-American
   settlers were undoubtedly modifying the regional landscape over the
   past 250+ yr, and at least some of the sediment liberated by land-use
   changes has likely contributed to elevated MAR[clastic] since at least
   1890 CE. The increasing content of clastic material in the centuries
   preceding the uppermost event deposit, evident from decreasing LOI and
   increasing ρ[db], magnetic susceptibility, and potassium (Fig. 6), may
   record the subtle, early impacts of Euro-American land-use changes.
   Collectively, these results suggest that while both hydrologic and
   human disturbances to the landscape may increase sediment availability
   and mobilize sediment in portions of a watershed, the export of
   fine-grained sediment from the largest watersheds in the region likely
   displays a muted response to landscape disturbances. This finding has
   important implications regarding the potential magnitude of the impacts
   from Euro-American land-use changes on the redistribution of sediment
   across the northeastern United States over the past few centuries.

CONCLUSIONS

   Ossipee Lake preserves a continuous record of watershed erosion
   spanning the late glacial and the entirety of the Holocene through the
   period of regional Euro-American settlement. Variability in
   sedimentation throughout the record reflects ongoing paraglacial
   landscape adjustment. The period of most active landscape adjustment
   persisted until ~12,000 cal yr BP. Decreasing mass accumulation of
   clastic sediment from 12,000 to ~9000 cal yr BP reflects the gradual
   stabilization of the landscape as river channels approached equilibrium
   profiles, extensive forests were established, and the most readily
   available sediment supplies were exhausted or isolated. An apparent
   trend of increasing sediment yield from 9000 cal yr BP through 1850 CE
   is consistent with increasing effective precipitation over this period
   and suggests a dominant hydroclimatic control of erosion on long
   timescales. However, the overall sediment yield and magnitude of
   changes in sediment yield from the Ossipee watershed remain low
   throughout the Holocene, suggesting a relatively low sensitivity to
   change and minimal impact from millennial-scale changes in vegetation
   or regional fire frequency. A muted response to Euro-American land-use
   changes and lack of distinct depositional signatures related to known
   extreme floods or historical land-use activity further reflect the lake
   and watershed system's limited sensitivity to disturbances. Downstream
   export of fine-grained sediment is limited by trapping and storage
   among hillslope, floodplain, lake, and wetland depocenters that become
   increasingly abundant as watershed size increases. This result suggests
   that the export of fine-grained sediment from the largest watersheds in
   the region likely experienced a modest response to Holocene landscape
   changes.

evolution in reverse is nothing surprising

   Published 28 July 2021

   From Ben Haller, Ithaca, New York, US

   You report research suggesting that after land-dwelling tetrapods
   evolved from fish, some tetrapod species “surprisingly” evolved to live
   in the water again (19 June, p 21).

   But is this surprising? We know that cetaceans made the same
   transition, even after becoming far more adapted to life on land than
   early tetrapods. More broadly, we know many flightless bird species had
   a flying ancestor, many aquatic insects descended from insects that
   evolved on land and many parasites have lost limbs or eyes, say, that
   are no longer needed.

   The idea that evolution is unidirectional is a fallacy, as Stephen Jay
   Gould wrote. The reality is that where there is a niche, evolution
   often finds ways to fill it, regardless of the direction of previous
   evolution.

How could evolution arise from conscious agents?

   Published 4 September 2019

   From Paul Mealing, Melbourne, Australia

   Donald Hoffman claims to have used the theory of evolution by natural
   selection to discover that what we perceive isn’t objective reality,
   but an interface with it (3 August, p 34). He says evolution itself may
   be just an interface projection of deeper dynamics stemming from a
   network of conscious agents. But such agents arrive late in the fossil
   record, so how could evolution arise before they existed?

How can evolution happen without external reality?

   Published 4 March 2020

   From Paul Mealing, Melbourne, Australia

   Your collection of articles on reality was informative (1 February, p
   39). Most provocative was Alison George reporting Donald Hoffman’s
   claim that nothing we perceive resembles reality and we are “born with
   a virtual reality headset on”. He says evolution gave us this to
   simplify things so we had “what we need to play the game of life”, and
   that what we perceive is an abstract data structure that represents
   something that “doesn’t even exist in space and time”. The implication
   that evolution therefore doesn’t occur in space and time creates
   problems for me. Hoffman goes on to say that evolution has shaped us to
   see things that we have to take seriously, to see what we need to stay
   alive, but that “does not, logically, permit us to say that we’re
   seeing the truth”.

   But evolution occurs by natural selection, which requires an
   environment for biological agents to interact with. Assuming that we
   are born with such a VR headset, the “data structure” it creates must
   surely closely resemble the external environment it interacts with in
   space and time – otherwise we wouldn’t survive.

Perhaps evolution has squared that circle (1)

   Published 13 January 2021

   From Rachel Mckeown, Aberfan, Mid Glamorgan, UK

   You wonder why animals haven’t evolved wheels (19/26 December 2020, p
   50). It is worth noting that the body of an organism isn’t the boundary
   of its phenotype.

   Richard Dawkins introduced the “extended phenotype” concept in which a
   cascade of causality ultimately stemming from genes can eventually lead
   to non-biological products, examples being architectures like beaver
   dams. Could the wheel similarly be considered an extended phenotype of
   humans, constructed once evolution had invented sufficiently advanced
   intelligence?

   Non-biological materials don’t face the same inherent limits as living
   tissue, such as the blood supply requirement. When phenotypes are
   expanded according to Dawkins’s framework, the design book for
   evolution to explore could massively expand.

Perhaps evolution has squared that circle (3)

   Published 13 January 2021

   From Martin Jenkins, London, UK

   Michael Marshall’s article on why animals don’t have wheels correctly
   addresses the issue that they are only useful on firm, flat surfaces,
   which are rare in nature, but perhaps misses the question: how did such
   surfaces come to be? In other words, in terms of human technological
   evolution, which came first, the wheel or the road?

Spiralling school of jack fish image takes photography prize

   By Gege Li

   18 August 2021

   New Scientist Default Image

   Kristen Brown

   THIS stunning selection of images showcases the world’s biodiversity to
   highlight the importance of protecting it. The pictures represent some
   of the winners and runners-up of this year’s BMC Ecology and evolution
   photography competition, which invited researchers to submit images
   that they think encapsulate the diversity of animals and plants.

   The main image is the overall winner, taken by coral reef ecologist
   Kristen Brown. She captured this school of jack fish at Heron Island in
   Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, and describes the scene as a metaphor
   for the climate change, pollution and overfishing crisis spiralling out
   of control in and around the world’s oceans.

   biologist Roberto García-Roa shows soldier termites using an abandoned
   rope to migrate across a forest in Malaysia.

   Kseniya Vereshchagina, an ecologist who studies Lake Baikal in Siberia,
   was the overall runner-up for her image of Eulimnogammarus verrucosus
   with a fluffy parasitic infection. Heavy industry and tourism in the
   lake weakens the immunity of these crustaceans, making them more

Perhaps evolution has squared that circle (2)

   Published 13 January 2021

   From Ian Flitcroft, Dublin, Ireland

   The arguments cited against the evolution of wheels in living things
   include the problem of the environment not being smooth and the
   challenge of supplying blood to a biological wheel.

   Maybe there are exceptions. Tumbleweed lacks blood, but has evolved a
   rolling solution that is perfectly suited to its flat, desert
   environment. Its “wheeled” design has a clear advantage, allowing
   distribution of the plant and its seeds over a wide area.

   It is sometimes suggested that we are the only creature to have
   invented the wheel. I think dung beetles may have beaten us by millions
   of years, “inventing” a way to get collections of dung larger than
   themselves uphill: rolling them.

Large moons are still significant for evolution

   Published 16 January 2019

   From Guy Cox, St Albans, New South Wales, Australia

   Eric Kvaalen notes the sun's contribution to tides on Earth (Letters,
   15 December 2018), in response to my letter on the importance of lunar
   tides to life moving from the oceans to land (3 November 2018). With
   respect, I didn't suggest that there would be no tides on Earth without
   our large moon. But the moon is the major determinant of our tides.

   Large tides may have allowed life to move onto land despite the
   advantages of the ocean: narrower temperature range, no risk of
   dehydration, little need for strong skeletons, and so on. If we ever do
   find intelligent life elsewhere, I still predict it will be aquatic.

evolution might stop humans from solving climate change, researchers say

   by Marcus Wolf, University of Maine
   evolution might stop humans from solving climate change, says new study
   Dimensions of environmental management create an attractor landscape
   for long-term human evolution. Environmental sustainability challenges
   (curved frontiers) require a minimum level of cooperation in a society
   of a certain minimum spatial size. Alternative potential paths move
   humanity toward different long-term evolutionary outcomes. In path B,
   competition between societies over common environmental resources
   creates cultural selection between groups for increasingly direct
   competition and conflict. Path A, growing cooperation between societies
   facilitates the emergence of global cultural traits to preserve shared
   environmental benefits. Credit: Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
   Society B: Biological Sciences (2023). DOI: 10.1098/rstb.2022.0259

   Central features of human evolution may stop our species from resolving
   global environmental problems like climate change, says a recent study
   led by the University of Maine.

   Humans have come to dominate the planet with tools and systems to
   exploit natural resources that were refined over thousands of years
   through the process of cultural adaptation to the environment.
   University of Maine evolutionary biologist Tim Waring wanted to know
   how this process of cultural adaptation to the environment might
   influence the goal of solving global environmental problems. What he
   found was counterintuitive.

   The project sought to understand three core questions: how human
   evolution has operated in the context of environmental resources, how
   human evolution has contributed to the multiple global environmental
   crises, and how global environmental limits might change the outcomes
   of human evolution in the future.

   Waring's team outlined their findings in a new paper published in
   Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. Other authors of the
   study include Zach Wood, UMaine alumni, and Eörs Szathmáry, a professor
   at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary.

Human expansion

   The study explored how human societies' use of the environment changed
   over our evolutionary history. The research team investigated changes
   in the ecological niche of human populations, including factors such as
   the natural resources they used, how intensively they were used, what
   systems and methods emerged to use those resources and the
   environmental impacts that resulted from their usage.
   [INS: :INS]

   This effort revealed a set of common patterns. Over the last 100,000
   years, human groups have progressively used more types of resources,
   with more intensity, at greater scales and with greater environmental
   impacts. Those groups often then spread to new environments with new
   resources.

   The global human expansion was facilitated by the process of cultural
   adaptation to the environment. This leads to the accumulation of
   adaptive cultural traits—social systems and technology to help exploit
   and control environmental resources such as agricultural practices,
   fishing methods, irrigation infrastructure, energy technology and
   social systems for managing each of these.

   "Human evolution is mostly driven by cultural change, which is faster
   than genetic evolution. That greater speed of adaptation has made it
   possible for humans to colonize all habitable land worldwide," says
   Waring, associate professor with the UMaine Senator George J. Mitchell
   Center for Sustainability Solutions and the School of Economics.

   Moreover, this process accelerates because of a positive feedback
   process: as groups get larger, they accumulate adaptive cultural traits
   more rapidly, which provides more resources and enables faster growth.

   "For the last 100,000 years, this has been good news for our species as
   a whole." Waring says, "but this expansion has depended on large
   amounts of available resources and space."

   Today, humans have also run out of space. We have reached the physical
   limits of the biosphere and laid claim to most of the resources it has
   to offer. Our expansion also is catching up with us. Our cultural
   adaptations, particularly the industrial use of fossil fuels, have
   created dangerous global environmental problems that jeopardize our
   safety and access to future resources.

Global limits

   To see what these findings mean for solving global challenges like
   climate change, the research team looked at when and how sustainable
   human systems emerged in the past. Waring and his colleagues found two
   general patterns. First, sustainable systems tend to grow and spread
   only after groups have struggled or failed to maintain their resources
   in the first place.

   For example, the U.S. regulated industrial sulfur and nitrogen dioxide
   emissions in 1990, but only after we had determined that they caused
   acid rain and acidified many water bodies in the Northeast. This
   delayed action presents a major problem today as we threaten other
   global limits. For climate change, humans need to solve the problem
   before we cause a crash.

   Second, researchers also found evidence that strong systems of
   environmental protection tend to address problems within existing
   societies, not between them. For example, managing regional water
   systems requires regional cooperation, regional infrastructure and
   technology, and these arise through regional cultural evolution. The
   presence of societies of the right scale is therefore a critical
   limiting factor.

   Tackling the climate crisis effectively will probably require new
   worldwide regulatory, economic and social systems—ones that generate
   greater cooperation and authority than existing systems like the Paris
   Agreement. To establish and operate those systems, humans need a
   functional social system for the planet, which we don't have.

   "One problem is that we don't have a coordinated global society which
   could implement these systems," says Waring, "We only have sub-global
   groups, which probably won't suffice. But you can imagine cooperative
   treaties to address these shared challenges. So, that's the easy
   problem."

   The other problem is much worse, Waring says. In a world filled with
   sub-global groups, cultural evolution among these groups will tend to
   solve the wrong problems, benefiting the interests of nations and
   corporations and delaying action on shared priorities. Cultural
   evolution among groups would tend to exacerbate resource competition
   and could lead to direct conflict between groups and even global human
   dieback.

   "This means global challenges like climate change are much harder to
   solve than previously considered," says Waring. "It's not just that
   they are the hardest thing our species has ever done. They absolutely
   are. The bigger problem is that central features in human evolution are
   likely working against our ability to solve them. To solve global
   collective challenges we have to swim upstream."
   [INS: :INS]

Looking forward

   Waring and his colleagues think that their analysis can help navigate
   the future of human evolution on a limited Earth. Their paper is the
   first to propose that human evolution may oppose the emergence of
   collective global problems and further research is needed to develop
   and test this theory.

   Waring's team proposes several applied research efforts to better
   understand the drivers of cultural evolution and search for ways to
   reduce global environmental competition, given how human evolution
   works. For example, research is needed to document the patterns and
   strength of human cultural evolution in the past and present. Studies
   could focus on the past processes that lead to the human domination of
   the biosphere, and on the ways cultural adaptation to the environment
   is occurring today.

   But if the general outline proves to be correct, and human evolution
   tends to oppose collective solutions to global environmental problems,
   as the authors suggest, then some very pressing questions need to be
   answered. This includes whether we can use this knowledge to improve
   the global response to climate change.

   "There is hope, of course, that humans may solve climate change. We
   have built cooperative governance before, although never like this: in
   a rush at a global scale," Waring says.

   The growth of international environmental policy provides some hope.
   Successful examples include the Montreal Protocol to limit
   ozone-depleting gases and the global moratorium on commercial whaling.

   New efforts should include fostering more intentional, peaceful and
   ethical systems of mutual self-limitation, particularly through market
   regulations and enforceable treaties, that bind human groups across the
   planet together ever more tightly into a functional unit.

   But that model may not work for climate change.

   "Our paper explains why and how building cooperative governance at the
   global scale is different, and helps researchers and policymakers be
   more clear-headed about how to work toward global solutions," says
   Waring.

   This new research could lead to a novel policy mechanism to address the
   climate crisis: Modifying the process of adaptive change among
   corporations and nations may be a powerful way to address global
   environmental risks.

   As for whether humans can continue to survive on a limited planet,
   Waring says, "We don't have any solutions for this idea of a long-term
   evolutionary trap, as we barely understand the problem. If our
   conclusions are even close to being correct, we need to study this much
   more carefully."

The mighty coast redwoods are born to change. But can they evolve fast enough
to survive climate warming?

   by Daniel Lewis, Los Angeles Times

   Coast redwoods—enormous, spectacular trees, some reaching nearly 400
   feet, the tallest plants on the planet—thrive mostly in a narrow strip
   of land in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Most of them
   grow from southern Oregon down into Northern California, snugged up
   against the rugged Pacific coast.

   They have grown by slowly responding to moisture and rich alluvial soil
   over millenniums, combined with a genetic payload that pushes them to
   the upper limits of tree height. They are at risk—down to perhaps
   70,000 individuals, falling from at least a half-million trees before
   humans arrived, but that's not a new story, for we are all at risk.

   Redwoods, like all trees, are engineered marvels. People don't tend to
   think of natural things as "structures," leaving that term to stand in
   for buildings, bridges, and dams. But although trees were not built by
   humans, they didn't just happen.

   They have come into their own through the inexorably turning wheels of
   natural selection and evolution, responding to environmental pressures,
   genetic drift, and mutation (they even have two kinds of leaves that
   help the trees adapt to both wet and dry conditions). They are born to
   change, just as humans are born to change.

   evolution is usually a very slow process, although sometimes it's
   surprisingly quick. New, intense pressures of a warming and changing
   climate are speeding things up and forcing researchers and
   horticulturists to examine approaches to climate change resilience and
   technologies like geographic information systems.

   Of course, there are differences between man-made edifices and trees. A
   structure or building typically is a sort of island unto itself,
   separate from its neighbors; in contrast, the coast redwood is an
   ecosystem with enormously broad consequences for other life forms.
   [INS: :INS]

   Life is folded in and among the redwoods, below and within and about
   them. The trees are integrators, bringing together many life forms.
   Some of these life forms rely on the tree, others on occupants in and
   around the tree.

   The coast redwood hosts so many different ecological interactions that
   it's faintly ridiculous. Consider the wandering salamander, which
   usually spends its entire life high in the canopy, but sometimes must
   jump out to escape predators. Without wings or gliding, it falls from a
   great height only to land perfectly unharmed on the ground.

   It took scientists dropping these creatures into a wind tunnel and
   filming them with high-speed cameras to understand why they didn't end
   up as a wet splat on the forest floor. As it turns out, the
   salamander's flattened body shape and large feet with long toes create
   just enough drag and balance for a soft landing.

   Redwoods are so large that one reportedly was found to house a Sitka
   spruce, 8 feet tall, growing far off the ground within the larger tree.
   Redwoods also have served for millenniums as nesting habitat for huge
   California condors, with wingspans of nearly 10 feet.

   There's also a place for the tiny, living side by side with all of the
   largeness tucked in the complex, secret interstices of these trees.
   Nestled into extensive mats of ferns that grow high up in redwood
   canopies, researchers find aquatic crustaceans called copepods that
   normally would live in larger bodies of water. No one knows how they
   got into the trees, but the fern mats trap enormous quantities of
   moisture from rain and fog, creating wetlands in the sky.

   Yet even species as enduring as coast redwoods are affected by climate
   change. Diminished moisture stresses the trees, making them grow with
   less vigor. New fire dangers put them at risk, and more frequent floods
   erode the big trees' footing. But redwoods also are adapting.

   A 2018 survey of nine large redwood trees found a total of 137 species
   of lichen growing on the trees, including several that were new to
   science. One was Xylopsora canopeorum, whose specific name celebrates
   the canopy where it was discovered.

   This lichen seems to be unique to the warmer and drier forests in
   California's Sonoma and Santa Cruz counties, in the southern part of
   the coast redwoods' range. This is an exciting finding, for it provides
   evidence that new forms of life—ecosystem partners—may be evolving in
   sync with trees that are also evolving in the face of climate change.

   A pair of redwoods grow just outside my office at the Huntington in San
   Marino, which is some 700 miles south of the coast redwood's usual
   range. I've resisted giving names to this duo, although many giant
   redwoods have monikers like Adventure, Brutus, Nugget, Paradox, and
   Atlas—most named by the scientists who first quantified their extreme
   heights.

   The redwoods outside my window are perhaps 100 feet tall—puny by
   comparison to their northern brethren. But they are healthy and will
   continue to be shaped by their immediate environments. They've traveled
   far to get here, planted more than a half-century ago by an earlier
   generation of horticulturalists, and they're thriving in their new
   home. We should all be so lucky.

   html content. However, as you have access to this content, a full PDF
   is available via the ‘Save PDF’ action button.

   OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has
   provided continual support for the Georgia Clinical and Translational
   Science Alliance (CTSA) since 2006. An overarching goal of the Georgia
   CTSA is to accelerate clinical and translational research to impact
   health in Georgia and beyond. Toward these ends, a primary objective
   has been to support interdisciplinary research projects encompassing 2
   or more disciplinary domains. The goal of the present study is to
   evaluate the degree to which interdisciplinary research projects
   increased in prevalence during the first decade of funding.
   METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We began by using PubMed to identify all
   publications citing the Georgia CTSA hub (n=1865), categorizing each
   article as encompassing 1 or more research domain using a taxonomy
   derived from the Web of Science. We created 1 network for each of the
   10 years with nodes representing research areas and ties between pairs
   of nodes representing the presence of 1 or more publication integrating
   both research areas. We conducted longitudinal network analyses using
   an approach called MCMC MLE Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models,
   which models the antecedents of networks over time. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED
   RESULTS: Supporting Georgia CTSA objectives, results suggest the
   probability of publications connecting multiple research areas
   increased over time, with substantially greater increases appearing
   initially as compared to later years. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF
   IMPACT: This study advances an innovative approach to modeling the
   system-wide impact of CTSA hub funding.

Unraveling the evolutionary origins of umami and sweet taste preferences

   by Kindai University
   Unraveling the evolutionary origins of umami and sweet taste
   preferences A new study led by researchers from Kindai University
   identified five new groups of umami and sweet taste receptors within
   the TAS1R family (TAS1R 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) and also diversity in TAS1R2
   and TAS1R3 genes. Credit: Hidenori Nishihara from Kindai University

   The perception of taste is one of the most important senses and helps
   us identify beneficial foods and avoid harmful substances. For
   instance, our fondness for sweet and savory foods results from our need
   to consume carbohydrates and proteins. Given their importance as an
   evolutionary trait, researchers around the world are investigating how
   taste receptors originated and evolved over a period of time. Obtaining
   these insights into the feeding behavior of organisms can help them
   paint a picture of the history of life on Earth.

   One of the important tastes in our taste palette is umami, or the
   savory taste, which is associated with proteins that form a vital part
   of the diets of many organisms. The taste receptor type 1 (T1R) detects
   sweet and umami tastes among mammals. This taste receptor is encoded by
   the TAS1R, a family of genes, including TAS1R1, TAS1R2, and TAS1R3, and
   comes from a common ancestor of bony vertebrates.

   However, this gene pattern is not observed in coelacanth and
   cartilaginous fishes, where "taxonomically unplaced" TAS1R genes have
   been identified, suggesting an incomplete understanding of the
   evolutionary history of taste receptors.

   Now, however, a research team led by Associate Professor Hidenori
   Nishihara from Kindai University and Professor Yoshiro Ishimaru from
   Meiji University, Japan, have identified five new, previously
   undiscovered groups within the TAS1R family. This discovery is a result
   of a genome-wide survey of jawed vertebrates including all major fish
   groups.

   The study, published in Nature Ecology &amp; evolution on December 13,
   2023, includes the contributions of Senior Assistant Professor Yasuka
   Toda from Meiji University, Professor Masataka Okabe from The Jikei
   University School of Medicine, Professor Shigehiro Kuraku from the
   National Institute of Genetics, and Project Associate Professor Shinji
   Okada from The University of Tokyo.

   "Our study revealed that as compared to most modern vertebrates, the
   vertebrate ancestor possessed more T1Rs. These findings challenge the
   paradigm that only three T1R family members have been retained during
   evolution," says Prof. Nishihara.

   preferences The color key indicates the names of the various T1R
   members. Filled, colored circles on the branches indicate the presence
   of the TAS1R members, whereas open circles indicate their absence.

   The novel taste receptor genes, named TAS1R4, TAS1R5, TAS1R6, TAS1R7,
   and TAS1R8 by the researchers, were categorized based on their
   distribution among species with a common ancestor. The researchers
   found TAS1R4 genes to be present in lizards, axolotl, lungfishes,
   coelacanth, bichir, and cartilaginous fishes, but absent in mammals,
   birds, crocodilians, turtles, and teleost fishes. In addition, axolotl,
   lungfishes, and coelacanth were found to have TAS1R5.

   The researchers observed a close evolutionary relationship between
   TAS1R5, TAS1R1, and TAS1R2, indicating a shared ancestry between these
   genes. The cartilaginous fishes possess TAS1R6 exclusively. Notably,
   the researchers found that TAS1R6 evolved from the same ancestral gene
   that led to TAS1R1, TAS1R2, and TAS1R5 genes. While axolotl and lizards
   possess TAS1R7, bichir and lungfishes possess TAS1R8. The researchers
   determined that these two genes originated in the common ancestor of
   jawed vertebrates.

   In addition to these new genes, the study revealed diversity in the
   existing TAS1R genes. For instance, they found that TAS1R3 of bony
   vertebrates could be divided into TAS1R3A and TAS1R3B. TAS1R3A was
   present in tetrapods and lungfishes, while TAS1R3B was identified in
   amphibians, lungfishes, coelacanths, and ray-finned fishes.
   Additionally, the genome survey found TAS1R2 to have diversified into
   two distinct groups (TAS1R2A and TAS1R2B), challenging the conventional
   idea that TAS1R2 forms a single gene group.

   "We found that the TAS1R phylogenetic tree comprises of a total of 11
   TAS1R clades, revealing an unexpected gene diversity," adds Prof.
   Nishihara.

   The findings also suggest that the first TAS1R gene appeared in jawed
   vertebrates around 615–473 million years ago. The gene then underwent
   several duplications to produce nine taste receptor genes (TAS1R1,2A,
   2B, 3A, 3B, 4, 5, 7, and 8) in the common ancestor of bony vertebrates.
   Over time, some of these genes were lost in different lineages, with
   mammals and teleosts retaining only three TAS1Rs (TAS1R1, TAS1R2A, and
   TAS1R3A in mammals).

   In addition to shedding light on the evolutionary history, the findings
   also have practical applications. Explaining these to us, Prof.
   Nishihara says, "These findings make it easier for us to deduce the
   taste preferences of diverse vertebrates. This, in turn, can have
   potential applications such as the development of pet foods and
   attractants tailored to the preferences of fish, amphibians, and
   reptiles."

   David Baker’s Sex: Two Billion Years of Procreation and Recreation
   condenses the story of the evolution of (predominantly) reproductive
   sex into 300 pages. That is quite a feat.

   The book is one of the latest additions to the popular “Big History”
   genre. First defined by Macquarie University historian David Christian
   in the early 1990s, the idea of Big History is that the temporal scale
   on which history should be studied is “the whole of time”. Its ambition
   is no less than to survey history from the Big Bang to the present,
   taking an interdisciplinary approach to its scholarship.

   Baker is a science writer with a PhD in Big History and one of the
   writers behind the Big History Crash Course on YouTube. In his
   introduction to Sex, he declares “this is the first book that seeks to
   weave together the grand narrative of sex in its entirety”.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Sex: Two Billion Years of Procreation and Recreation – David Christian
   (Black Inc.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   The book is divided into three sections. The first – titled
   evolutionary Foreplay – covers the period from 13.8 billion to 66
   million years ago. Baker races through the 10 billion years following
   the Big Bang, when “the cosmos was devoid of life”.

   He summarises the formation of Earth and its atmosphere, the origins of
   living organisms 3.8 billion years ago, the emergence of DNA, and the
   cloning (asexual reproduction) of “microscopic blobs living on the edge
   of underwater volcanoes”.

   We are taken from the earliest forms of sexual reproduction between two
   single-celled organisms to the differentiation of cells, and on to the
   evolution of specialised reproductive cells, the gametes. This
   development was followed by the rapid appearance of diverse animal
   species, from fish and amphibians to reptiles, insects, dinosaurs,
   birds and mammals.

   In the second section, Primate Climax – which covers the period from 66
   million to 315,000 years ago – we learn about the development of
   external genitals and the birth of “the age of the orgasm”, as well as
   primate sexual behaviour and social organisation.

   The final section, Cultural Afterglow, which extends from 315,000 years
   ago to the present, traces the history of Homo sapiens from
   hunter-gatherers, to the first agrarian societies, and on to the
   present day.

   The word length of each section is inversely proportional to the time
   scale being described – a reflection of our relative knowledge about
   sexual behaviour, but also its evolving complexity over time.

evolution

   Baker’s prose is animated and deliberately raunchy, making what would
   be a dense read light and entertaining. But to weave his “grand
   narrative of sex” he also anthropomorphises reproduction of even the
   earliest living organisms.

   For example, explaining theory behind the first, possibly accidental,
   mixing of genes two billion years ago, Baker describes “Snowball Earth”
   – a period when the average global temperature was minus 50 degrees
   Celsius. His argument is that asexual reproduction at this time of
   catastrophic climatic conditions was causing overpopulation and that
   sexual reproduction would slow population growth.

   This sounds counter-intuitive, but sexual reproduction takes time, much
   longer than simply cloning oneself. Two separate, unrelated organisms
   need to find each other and then exchange DNA. And it seems that the
   very first time this happened was what Baker describes as “cannibal
   sex”: one cell ingesting another due to starvation and accidentally
   mixing DNA. Baker thus writes:

     To put it slightly more crudely, 2 billion years ago our ancestors
     felt so much pressure from the environment that they needed to fuck
     in order to survive.

   A few pages later, he writes “furthermore, sex bequeathed upon those
   hardy, horny eukaryotes the potential for rapid evolution into
   increasingly complex species”.

   Throughout his descriptions of sexual and reproductive behaviour of
   pre-primate species, Baker attributes very human characteristics to
   living organisms that simply don’t make sense. While this can be
   amusing, I also found it slightly irritating. The long bow being drawn
   between “sexual” behaviour involving the first exchange of DNA by
   single-celled organisms and the first modern humans is long indeed.

   Eukaryotes. Rattiya Thongdumhyu/Shutterstock

   Baker provides an interesting summary of the diversity among our
   primate ancestors. He notes differences in anatomy and genital size,
   and considers variations in practices such as masturbation and sexual
   partnering, including polygamy, monogamy, promiscuity, homosexual and
   bisexual behaviour.

   He delves into the issues of pleasure, romantic love and parenting, and
   related forms of social organisation, such as patriarchy and
   matriarchy. And he considers variations, such as patrilocality (where
   males remain in their families and females move out to live with the
   male parent of their offspring) and its reverse, matrilocality.

   Baker also points out that a pleasure response to copulation can be
   seen in fish and reptiles, similar to the sensations experienced after
   eating, but that the orgasm emerges with placental mammals.

   It is, however, the evolution of human culture that radically changes
   everything. Baker condenses a few hundred thousand years of the history
   of human sexuality into 150 pages. He covers diversity (including
   intersex characteristics and gender and sexual diversity) and considers
   the ways in which societies have controlled sexuality and sexual
   behaviour through legal and other sanctions.

   Central to these cultural practices is the control of female sexuality,
   which emerged with the development of agriculture and the need to
   retain land ownership and safeguard inheritance down patriarchal lines.

The future of sex

   In the book’s final chapter, The Future of Sex, Baker shares his belief
   that “Nurture has ceased to impede the sexual impulses of Nature”,
   leading to a state where “loneliness is at an all-time high and
   personal happiness is at its lowest ebb”.

   This is a sweeping statement. How did we measure loneliness and
   personal happiness in, say, Ancient Egypt? Do experiences of loneliness
   and personal happiness vary around the globe? Do they mean different
   things in different cultures?

   Informing some of Baker’s thinking are statistics about the number of
   Millennials “projected to never get married in their lifetimes” and the
   decline in rates of casual sex. But it is not clear if they are only
   from studies in Western countries or how representative they are at a
   global level.

   Baker concludes the book with four categories of future forecasts. His
   “projected future” is based on current observation. Here he predicts a
   rise in singledom and a state where promiscuity and sexlessness both
   exist and birth rates decline.

   His “probable future” anticipates a “cultural rejection of
   relationships as the key to happiness”. It would involve more hook-ups
   and the growing replacement of human-to-human sex with sex dolls and
   bots. Alternatively, Baker suggests humanity might swing back towards
   traditional monogamous couplings, or a revival of polygyny, or a
   “promiscuity overdrive”.

   In a “possible future”, he considers how internet technology might lead
   to virtual, AI-driven partnered sex. Finally, in a “preposterous
   future”, he suggests that sex could cease to be important to living
   organisms at all.

   While Baker’s deliberations are interesting and worth pondering, it is
   difficult to accept his claim that “the liberalisation of attitudes
   towards sex has released human sexuality from the grip of culture”.
   Indeed, the statement is something of an oxymoron, since “liberalising
   attitudes” are themselves a cultural phenomenon.

   The “grip of culture” is still ever-present in the policing of female
   sexual behaviour, which continues to the present day the world over. So
   does the epidemic of sexual violence against women.

   The other aspect of Baker’s book that I wonder about is its
   “knowability”. How many of the “facts” presented are really known? How
   much is be conjecture? While there is an impressive list of references
   at the end of the book, Baker admits that many of the beliefs he shares
   about the evolution of sex are not certain.

   This speaks, in part, to the tensions that exist between “Big History”
   and “Deep History”. Big History presents itself as an answer to an
   existential question – why are we here? But, as some critics have
   argued, humans do not “easily fit into a Big History framework”.

   Baker concludes with a statement about what he wanted to achieve in
   writing this book. He hopes that “some aspects of sex have become
   slightly less baffling for the reader” and wishes his readers the
   “sensation of feeling truly loved” – a kind sentiment, but slightly at
   odds with what has come before.

   From my perspective, the world has a long way to go to achieve human
   rights for all in the areas of sexuality and gender. If Baker’s book
   helps this endeavour by getting us to think about human sexuality more
   deeply, then it will prove worthwhile.

   In evolutionary theory, adaptation is the biological mechanism by which
   organisms adjust to new environments or to changes in their current
   environment. Although scientists discussed adaptation prior to the
   1800s, it was not until then that Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel
   Wallace developed the theory of natural selection.

   Wallace believed that the evolution of organisms was connected in some
   way with adaptation of organisms to changing environmental conditions.
   In developing the theory of evolution by natural selection, Wallace and
   Darwin both went beyond simple adaptation by explaining how organisms
   adapt and evolve. The idea of natural selection is that traits that can
   be passed down allow organisms to adapt to the environment better than
   other organisms of the same species. This enables better survival and
   reproduction compared with other members of the species, leading to
   evolution.

   Organisms can adapt to an environment in different ways. They can adapt
   biologically, meaning they alter body functions. An example of
   biological adaptation can be seen in the bodies of people living at
   high altitudes, such as Tibet. Tibetans thrive at altitudes where
   oxygen levels are up to 40 percent lower than at sea level. Breathing
   air that thin would cause most people to get sick, but Tibetans’ bodies
   have evolved changes in their body chemistry. Most people can survive
   at high altitudes for a short time because their bodies raise their
   levels of hemoglobin, a protein that transports oxygen in the blood.
   However, continuously high levels of hemoglobin are dangerous, so
   increased hemoglobin levels are not a good solution to high-altitude
   survival in the long term. Tibetans seemed to have evolved genetic
   mutations that allow them to use oxygen far more efficently without the
   need for extra hemoglobin.

   Organisms can also exhibit behavioral adaptation. One example of
   behavioral adaptation is how emperor penguins in Antarctica crowd
   together to share their warmth in the middle of winter.

   Scientists who studied adaptation prior to the development of
   evolutionary theory included Georges Louis Leclerc Comte de Buffon. He
   was a French mathematician who believed that organisms changed over
   time by adapting to the environments of their geographical locations.
   Another French thinker, Jean Baptiste Lamarck, proposed that animals
   could adapt, pass on their adaptations to their offspring, and
   therefore evolve. The example he gave stated the ancestors of giraffes
   might have adapted to a shortage of food from short trees by stretching
   their necks to reach higher branches. In Lamarck’s thinking, the
   offspring of a giraffe that stretched its neck would then inherit a
   slightly longer neck. Lamarck theorized that behaviors aquired in a
   giraffe's lifetime would affect its offspring. However, it was Darwin’s
   concept of natural selection, wherein favorable traits like a long neck
   in giraffes suvived not because of aquired skills, but because only
   giraffes that had long enough necks to feed themselves survived long
   enough to reproduce. Natural selection, then, provides a more
   compelling mechanism for adaptation and evolution than Lamarck's
   theories.

   Though they've been extinct for millions of years, the prehistoric

   evolution is an important field of study for scientists. It covers the
   study of changes organisms have undergone over time in response to
   different factors in their environment. All organisms, including
   humans, evolve over time. evolution occurs through natural selection,
   and is a force that has shaped every organism living today.
   When developing his theory of evolution and the concept of natural
   selection, Charles Darwin studied the species of finches in the
   Galapagos Islands and hypothesized that they all originated from a
   single common ancestor.

Darwin’s Finches

   Have the students read about and research the finches Darwin studied on
   the Galapagos Islands. Darwin noticed that different finches had
   differently shaped beaks. He also noticed that the various beak shapes
   were each best suited for handling certain types of food. Darwin knew
   that the finches had come from continental South America originally,
   but those that he saw on the islands were unlike the ones on the
   mainland. Darwin wondered what caused these finches to change when they
   made it to the Galapagos Islands. Have students test the ability of
   different beaks to get different types of food. Provide students with
   spoons, forks, metal binders clip, and tweezers to represent different
   types of beaks and food bowl with foam packing peanuts, small bird
   seed, large bird seed (sunflower seeds), and toothpicks. Have student
   try the different tools and identify which tool works best with which
   foods.
   As the Earth grows warmer due to climate change, the colorful, lush,
   but delicate ecosystems of coral reefs are being forced to evolve
   quickly to survive the stresses of a warming planet.

National Geographic Explorer Jingchun Li: evolution of “Living Solar Panels”

   The first thing you notice when visiting a healthy marine coral reef is
   the number of different fishes and the many bright colors of both the
   fishes and the corals. Marine biodiversity refers to the richness of
   different species living together in a community. Have the students
   read about National Geographic Explorer Jingchun Li and her research on
   marine biodiversity and biologically productive coral reef ecosystems.
   Li is studying how coral reefs and other organisms are undergoing
   macroevolution to cope with the stresses created by human disturbances
   to their ecosystem.

   Divide students into groups. Ask the students what stresses are taking
   place in the marine environment that coral reefs and other marine
   organisms need to adapt to. Have them divide into small groups and
   research these changes and design solutions to address these
   disturbances.
   Modern humans, Homo sapiens, owe their existence to a collection of
   earlier, now-extinct Homo species, like this Homo
   neanderthalensis, who's skull appears similar, but not quite identical,
   to the skulls of modern humans.

Human evolution

   Scientists who study early humans depend on fossil evidence to help
   them sort out how our ancestors evolved over time. When looking at the
   fossils, scientists look for clues to changes in different
   characteristics such as brain size, skull shape, locomotion, and jaw
   size. Have the students learn about human evolution, then have them
   work through the Mystery Skull Interactive to use clues to identify
   fossils.
   The Count Raggi's bird of paradise (Paradisaea raggiana) is not only a
   stunningly colorful and elegant bird, it is also the national bird of
   Papua New Guinea.

evolution in Isolation

   Have the students watch the video about the birds living on the island
   of Papua in Indonesia. This isolated island is a paradise with a lush
   and resource-rich habitat. Male birds of many different species have
   evolved elaborate ways of attracting mates. Ask the students, why is it
   important for a species to have the strongest males mate with the
   females and how does this affect the species?
   Jeremy Martin excavates crocodile fossils from Cretaceous sediment to
   better understand how crocodiles have evolved over millions of years.

National Geographic Explorer Jeremy Emiland Martin: evolution of Crocodiles

   Have the students read about Jeremy Emiland Martin’s work on the
   evolution of crocodiles and then have them research how modern
   crocodiles have been evolving since the time of the dinosaurs. Because
   crocodiles are found in so many different areas of the world, it is
   important to go back to where they first emerged to learn about their
   evolutionary beginnings. Ask the students, how have crocodiles evolved
   since the Cretaceous Period? What might have caused crocodiles to
   evolve? Why were these traits favorable in this particular environment?

Genetic Variation

Genetic Variation

   Genetic variation is the presence of differences in sequences of genes
   between individual organisms of a species. It enables natural

   Genetic variation refers to differences among the genomes of members of
   the same species. A genome is all the hereditary information—all the
   genes—of an organism. For instance, the human genome contains somewhere
   between twenty and twenty-five thousand genes.

   Genes are units of hereditary information, and they carry instructions
   for building proteins. The genes that are encoded within these proteins
   are what enable cells to function. Most organisms that reproduce
   sexually have two copies of each gene, because each parent cell or
   organism donates a single copy of its genes to its offspring.
   Additionally, genes can exist in slightly different forms, called
   alleles, which further adds to genetic variation.

   The combination of alleles of a gene that an individual receives from
   both parents determines what biologists call the genotype for a
   particular trait, such as hair texture. The genotype that an individual
   possesses for a trait, in turn, determines the phenotype—the observable
   characteristics—such as whether that individual actually ends up with
   straight, wavy, or curly hair.

   Genetic variation within a species can result from a few different
   sources. Mutations, the changes in the sequences of genes in DNA, are
   one source of genetic variation. Another source is gene flow, or the
   movement of genes between different groups of organisms. Finally,
   genetic variation can be a result of sexual reproduction, which leads
   to the creation of new combinations of genes.

   Genetic variation in a group of organisms enables some organisms to
   survive better than others in the environment in which they live.
   Organisms of even a small population can differ strikingly in terms of
   how well suited they are for life in a certain environment. An example
   would be moths of the same species with different color wings. Moths
   with wings similar to the color of tree bark are better able to
   camouflage themselves than moths of a different color. As a result, the
   tree-colored moths are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on
   their genes. This process is called natural selection, and it is the
   main force that drives evolution.

Artificial Selection

Artificial Selection

   Artificial selection is the identification by humans of desirable
   traits in plants and animals, and the steps taken to enhance and
   perpetuate those traits in future generations. Artificial selection
   works the same way as natural selection, except that with natural
   selection it is nature, not human interference, that makes these
   decisions.

   In laying out the evidence for his theory of evolution by natural
   selection in his 1859 book, On the Origin of Species, the British
   naturalist and biologist Charles Darwin highlighted the physical traits
   and behaviors of several species of bird called finches. During a
   voyage in the 1830s, Darwin had observed these birds on the Galápagos
   Islands, a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean west of South America.

   Sometimes summed up by the phrase “survival of the fittest,” natural
   selection is based on the following principles: In nature, organisms
   produce more offspring than are able to survive and reproduce.
   Offspring with traits that make them more likely to survive, mature,
   and reproduce in the environment they inhabit pass on their traits to
   the next generation.

   As this happens generation after generation, natural selection acts as
   a kind of sieve, or a remover of undesirable traits. Organisms
   therefore gradually become better-suited for their environment. If the
   environment changes, natural selection will then push organisms to
   evolve in a different direction to adapt to their new circumstances.

   How does this relate to finches? On the Galápagos Islands, some finches
   appeared so different from others that Darwin did not realize at first
   that they were all finches. In fact, they were different species of
   finches with a variety of traits. Some finches, for instance, had long,
   narrow beaks, while others had short, thick beaks. Darwin concluded
   that the traits of the different populations of finches had changed
   over time, and that these variations were related to different
   environments in the islands. Each type of beak had evolved for a
   specific task. Where there was a large supply of seeds on the ground,
   for instance, short-beaked finches became more common, because these
   beaks were better at cracking open the seeds. Where cactus plants were
   more common, finches developed long, narrow beaks to extract pollen and
   nectar from cactus flowers.

   Darwin’s finches constituted powerful evidence for natural selection.
   But Darwin was also inspired greatly by the evolution that he saw in
   the traits of pigeons, not due to natural selection but rather
   artificial selection. Breeding pigeons was a popular hobby in England
   in Darwin’s time. By selecting which pigeons were allowed to mate,
   people had a profound effect on their appearance, such as the shape and
   size of their beaks and the color of their feathers.

   Dog breeding is another prime example of artificial selection. Although
   all dogs are descendants of the wolf, the use of artificial selection
   has allowed humans to drastically alter the appearance of dogs. For
   centuries, dogs have been bred for various desired characteristics,
   leading to the creation of a wide range of dogs, from the tiny
   Chihuahua to the massive Great Dane.

   Artificial selection has long been used in agriculture to produce
   animals and crops with desirable traits. The meats sold today are the
   result of the selective breeding of chickens, cattle, sheep, and pigs.
   Many fruits and vegetables have been improved or even created through
   artificial selection. For example, broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage
   were all derived from the wild mustard plant through selective
   breeding. Artificial selection appeals to humans since it is faster
   than natural selection and allows humans to mold organisms to their
   needs.

   Ideas aimed at explaining how organisms change, or evolve, over time
   date back to Anaximander of Miletus, a Greek philosopher who lived in
   the 500s B.C.E. Noting that human babies are born helpless, Anaximander
   speculated that humans must have descended from some other type of
   creature whose young could survive without any help. He concluded that
   those ancestors must be fish, since fish hatch from eggs and
   immediately begin living with no help from their parents. From this
   reasoning, he proposed that all life began in the sea.

   Anaximander was correct; humans can indeed trace our ancestry back to
   fish. His idea, however, was not a theory in the scientific meaning of
   the word, because it could not be subjected to testing that might
   support it or prove it wrong. In science, the word “theory” indicates a
   very high level of certainty. Scientists talk about evolution as a
   theory, for instance, just as they talk about Einstein’s explanation of
   gravity as a theory.

   A theory is an idea about how something in nature works that has gone
   through rigorous testing through observations and experiments designed
   to prove the idea right or wrong. When it comes to the evolution of
   life, various philosophers and scientists, including an
   eighteenth-century English doctor named Erasmus Darwin, proposed
   different aspects of what later would become evolutionary theory. But
   evolution did not reach the status of being a scientific theory until
   Darwin’s grandson, the more famous Charles Darwin, published his famous
   book On the Origin of Species. Darwin and a scientific contemporary of
   his, Alfred Russel Wallace, proposed that evolution occurs because of a
   phenomenon called natural selection.

   In the theory of natural selection, organisms produce more offspring
   than are able to survive in their environment. Those that are better
   physically equipped to survive, grow to maturity, and reproduce. Those
   that are lacking in such fitness, on the other hand, either do not
   reach an age when they can reproduce or produce fewer offspring than
   their counterparts. Natural selection is sometimes summed up as
   “survival of the fittest” because the “fittest” organisms—those most
   suited to their environment—are the ones that reproduce most
   successfully, and are most likely to pass on their traits to the next
   generation.

   This means that if an environment changes, the traits that enhance
   survival in that environment will also gradually change, or evolve.
   Natural selection was such a powerful idea in explaining the evolution
   of life that it became established as a scientific theory. Biologists
   have since observed numerous examples of natural selection influencing
   evolution. Today, it is known to be just one of several mechanisms by
   which life evolves. For example, a phenomenon known as genetic drift
   can also cause species to evolve. In genetic drift, some
   organisms—purely by chance—produce more offspring than would be
   expected. Those organisms are not necessarily the fittest of their
   species, but it is their genes that get passed on to the next
   generation.

Evolving Theory of evolution

Evolving Theory of evolution

   Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace developed the idea of evolution
   through natural selection. But this idea was not accepted by scientists
   until more evidence came along. Use this infographic to explore how
   Darwinism and genetics came together to explain what we know today
   about evolution.

   Idea for Use in the Classroom

   Introduce and share the infographic with students. Define key ideas
   such as natural selection, inheritance, and DNA. These activities can
   be done as in-class assignments, small group work, or they can be
   completed outside of class time. Introduce students to Charles Darwin’s
   research, Gregor Mendel’s work with pea plants, and James Watson and
   Francis Crick’s determination of the structure of DNA.

   Darwin Challenged

   Have students work in pairs to research the scientists and ideas that
   were used to challenge Darwin’s theory about the role of natural
   selection. Ask the pairs to choose one scientist or idea and make a
   poster that explains why that scientist thinks Darwin is wrong. Then
   have students write a response from Charles Darwin explaining why his
   theory of natural selection is correct.

   Lucy

   Have students search to find a tree of life diagram of human evolution.
   Ask students to identify where “Lucy” fits into the tree. Then ask
   students to research Lucy and write a short paragraph describing why
   she is an important find.

   Darwin’s Finches

   Have students work in groups to research the finches Darwin studied in
   the Galapagos. Have the groups select one type of finch and explain how
   its beak adapted through natural selection to gather its food.
   Encourage the groups to build models to demonstrate how the shape of
   the beak is best suited for obtaining certain types of food. Have the
   groups present their demonstration to the class.

   Tweeting Science

   Ask students to read through the timeline and select one of the
   entries. Then have them research that entry to learn more about how the
   discovery came about and what it adds to our understanding of
   evolution. After research, have students summarize how the entry
   supports the legacy of an idea by writing a 280-character tweet that
   announces the evidence.

   Natural Selection

   Tell students that Darwin, along with another scientist, Alfred Russel
   Wallace, were the first to propose the idea of evolution through
   natural selection. Today, this idea is widely accepted by scientists.
   Have students research and devise a demonstration of how natural
   selection works in plants or animals. Have students select a
   demonstration that they can present to the class.

   Properly understood, evolution is a scientific theory about the
   development of life and is consistent with Christian theology.

   Properly understood, evolution is a scientific theory about the
   development of life and is consistent with Christian theology.

Introduction

   Providing a definition of “evolution” is tricky because the word is
   used in different ways. First we need to distinguish between the
   broader worldview some associate with evolution and the scientific
   theory of evolution.

evolution as worldview

   Some people consider evolution to be equivalent to atheism, thinking it
   replaces God or otherwise rules out God’s involvement in the
   development of life. But that is a philosophical or worldview position
   (sometimes called “evolutionism” or simply “naturalism”), not a
   strictly scientific position.

   At BioLogos, we are against evolutionism and instead hold to the
   worldview of Christian theism. We call our position on origins
   “evolutionary Creation.” That is to say, we believe God is the Creator
   and also accept that evolution is the best scientific description for
   how life has developed. This is similar to saying we believe God
   provides for the growth and development of plants while we also accept
   that the theory of photosynthesis is the best scientific explanation
   for that process.

evolution as a scientific theory

   In non-scientific contexts, “theory” usually means something like a
   guess (e.g., I have a theory about…). But in its scientific sense, a
   theory is a tested and well-confirmed explanation for a set of
   observations. The observations explained by the theory of evolution
   come primarily from the fossil record, comparative morphology,
   biogeography, and now most importantly, genetics. evolution does not
   attempt to give a scientific explanation for the origin of life, but
   only for the development and diversification of lifeforms after the
   first life began.

   The theory of evolution states that all the lifeforms on earth share a
   common ancestor as a result of variation and selection over a very long
   time (currently thought to be around 4 billion years). Variation means
   that offspring are not exact replicas of their parents, and selection
   occurs when only some of those offspring go on to produce more of their
   own offspring. Common ancestry does not mean the species we find today
   have evolved from each other—dogs did not evolve from cats, and humans
   did not evolve from chimpanzees. Instead, if you go back far enough in
   the ancestral tree of any two organisms, common ancestry predicts that
   you’ll come to a “grandparent” of which both current organisms are
   descendants. For humans and our closest relatives the chimpanzees, you
   have to go back around 300,000 generations to find that common ancestor
   (that would be your 299,998th-great grandparent!). What did that
   process look like?
   Chimpanzee and her baby

   That ancient population (which was neither human nor chimpanzee) split
   into two groups, and these groups were reproductively isolated—that is,
   the members of each group only mated with other members of the their
   own group. Then over the many generations of offspring, different
   variations were preserved in each group. Eventually the characteristics
   of each group were different enough for scientists to recognize them as
   different species. The theory of evolution claims that a similar story
   could be told for the ancestral lineage of any two species that have
   ever lived.

Debates about evolution

   There is very little debate in the scientific community about this
   broad characterization of evolution (anyone who claims otherwise is
   either uninformed or deliberately trying to mislead). The observational
   evidence explained by common ancestry is overwhelming. Of course new
   data causes scientists to adjust some of the specifics (like how long
   ago species diverged, or which species are most closely related), but
   this core view is overwhelmingly supported and agreed upon by the vast
   majority of scientists in the field.

   But that is not to say there are no debates and controversies about
   evolution among those who accept this core view of the theory.
   evolutionary scientists debate the extent to which the variation
   element is explained by random genetic mutations, and how important
   other selection mechanisms are beyond reproductive fitness. Scientists
   have different views on topics like how gradual evolutionary change is
   and on the details of how natural selection works. And as we’ve already
   seen, there are significant differences of opinion about how to
   interpret various aspects of evolution with respect to worldviews, such
   as whether there is overall direction to evolution, and what the
   significance of evolution is for theology.

   At BioLogos we believe the best contemporary science is consistent with
   Christian theology. Find more information on evolution and the BioLogos
   perspective on origins in the other resources on this page or by

   Country Coordinating Mechanisms are core to the Global Fund’s
   contribution to health governance to help end HIV, tuberculosis and
   malaria while investing in resilient and sustainable systems for
   health. The CCM evolution Strategic Initiative is a catalytic
   opportunity to enhance the way our partnership works in countries and
   regions. The approach and methodology build from a pilot phase in
   2018-2019.

Objectives

   Oversight
   Engagement
   Positioning
   Operations
   Transition
   Regional coordination

   The objective of CCM evolution is to equip CCMs to facilitate inclusive
   oversight and meaningful engagement in alignment with national
   structures for sustained health governance. As tested in the pilot,
   this involves increased focus on four core responsibilities:
     * Oversight: Active oversight of existing and emerging investments
     * Engagement: Meaningful, inclusive and active participation of key
       stakeholders
     * Positioning: Working within national structures and existing
       emerging platforms to increase efficiency of health investments
     * Operations: CCM Secretariats’ core functions (including the code of
       conduct), enabling and sustaining health governance

Anticipated Results

   The anticipated results are to change business as usual, leveraging the
   opportunity of the strategic initiative to enhance CCMs, streamline
   processes and invest in results – strengthening governance for existing
   and emerging health challenges.

Implementation

   Implementation is being rolled out in waves through 2021. Steps,
   timelines and more information are in our overview materials:

       Fund Strategy
     * 2020-2022 Allocation: Sources and Uses of Funds

Pilot

   The CCM evolution started in 2018 with a pilot phase in 18 countries.
   The pilot focused on sustainably strengthening CCM performance in four
   areas: overseeing grants, ensuring linkages with national structures,
   engaging key stakeholders and strengthening how CCMs function. The
   results and lessons learned from the pilot were presented to the Global
   Fund Board and committees and serve as the foundation for the global
   implementation of CCM evolution. In 2019 the Board approved a US$15
   million strategic initiative to support the implementation.

Human evolution

   Wanting to understand who we are, where we come from and how we evolved
   is part of what makes us human.

   This an exciting time to be examining human evolution. Intriguing
   fossil and archaeological discoveries, combined with innovative
   techniques and DNA research, are transforming scientists' understanding
   of our ancient past.

   We now know of more than 20 hominin species that are part of our family
   tree. At least half of these species are based on fossils unearthed in
   the last 30 years.

   Museum scientists are at the forefront of research on the migration,
   characteristics and capabilities of these early human relatives, and
   the origin and cultural development of our species, Homo sapiens.

   Trace the evolution of humans since our lineage split from that of
   chimpanzees, explore what we have in common with our ancient relatives
   and discover research that is helping to answer questions about our
   past and future.

   Check This Out: evolution Refuted

   From Check This Out

   Biological evolution is the supposed process by which the first cell
   evolved into the diversity of life we see today. Natural selection and
   mutations are considered its driving force; however, evolution has
   never been observed despite numerous protestations to the contrary.
   Natural selection and mutations cannot add the information necessary to
   change one kind of organism into another. And it doesn’t take a science
   degree to understand why molecules-to-man evolution is impossible.

evolution Defined: “Macro vs. Micro” evolution

   evolution is a word that is used a lot but is poorly defined.
   evolutionists themselves frequently equivocate on the term, using it to
   mean multiple things, sometimes even within the same sentence.

   “Macroevolution” is used to describe the large-scale changes believed
   to be able to turn a blob of protoplasm into a person. By contrast,
   “microevolution” is intended to describe the small-scale changes in
   populations, such as those exhibited by Darwin’s finches—the finch
   populations change beak sizes regularly in response to environmental
   pressures. However, they remain finches. No new traits or major changes
   take place.

   Since the term evolution is so strongly associated with the
   particles-to-people myth, we tend to use the word speciation to explain
   adaptation and variation within the created kinds, such as that
   exhibited by the finches.Because the small-scale changes generally lead
   to a loss of genetic information rather than a gain of new information
   needed to create new traits like arms and eyes, microevolution can
   never lead to macroevolution. evolutionists tend to use these ideas
   interchangeably. For this reason, we avoid those terms, preferring to
   speak of speciation within created kinds (which we can observe and
   verify) and molecules-to-man evolution (which is unobservable and
   unverifiable).
   History Of evolution

History of evolution: Charles Darwin and Others

   Many people believe that evolution began with Charles Darwin in 1859.
   This belief, however, is inaccurate. evolution as an idea has existed
   since at least the Greek philosophers. A Frenchman named Jean-Baptiste
   Lamarck had proposed a form of evolution in the early 1800s. In fact,
   Darwin’s grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, engraved a Latin motto on his
   coach and book plates meaning “Everything from Shells,” indicating his
   belief in evolution.

   Darwin built on past ideas and added his own wrinkle, one he borrowed
   from creationist Edward Blyth. Darwin observed that farmers could breed
   all manner of animal varieties using artificial selection. He then
   extrapolated from this that, given the millions of years his friend
   Charles Lyell proposed, whole new types of organisms could evolve
   “naturally” using Blyth’s process, hence natural selection. What Blyth
   saw as a conservative force in God’s creation meant to keep populations
   from breaking down, Darwin turned into a creative force that turned
   organisms into entirely new kinds of organisms over eons of time.

   When Darwin published his famous book, the ground had already been
   prepared for its acceptance, particularly within the church. The
   scientific community, by and large, had accepted the millions-of-years
   hypothesis of Lyell and James Hutton, and these ideas, sadly, had
   seeped into the church. Numerous leading theologians of the day, such
   as Thomas Chalmers, were advocates of the Gap Theory, which attempted
   to add millions of years into the Bible. The influence of Chalmers and
   others like him caused many in the church to unquestioningly accept
   millions of years and some to even add Darwin’s evolutionary ideas into
   the Bible.

evolutionary Thought Since Darwin

   Since Darwin’s time, evolution has become the dominant dogma in the
   sciences, even in seemingly unrelated areas. It is impossible to go to
   a secular school and not get overdosed with evolutionary teaching. The
   base model of the dogma has changed very little since Darwin.

   evolutionists still teach that man evolved from apelike creatures over
   millions of years. Other aspects of the idea have been filled in so
   that the evolutionary skeleton looks a little more complete, at least
   for public consumption. However, digging beneath the surface reveals
   things are not well in the evolutionary dogma.

   evolution became permanently immortalized in American culture in 1925
   in what was termed the “Scopes Monkey Trial” in Tennessee. Attempting
   to challenge a Tennessee state law that forbade teaching human
   evolution, the ACLU prompted a substitute teacher named John Scopes to
   admit to breaking the law, even though he later acknowledged he had
   never done so. The trial took on monumental proportions when two of the
   most famous lawyers in America, Clarence Darrow and William Jennings
   Bryan, took opposite positions. The trial ended with Scopes being
   convicted, but not before Darrow tricked Bryan into testifying and used
   him as a pincushion to mock the Bible.

   The trial was later immortalized in a Hollywood move entitled Inherit
   the Wind, which got almost every basic fact about the case wrong and
   painted biblical creationists in the worst light possible. Tennessee’s
   law was eventually repealed, and Darwin’s ideas are now dominant in the
   public school system across the nation.
   Genetic Challenge

The Genetic Challenge to Classic Darwinian evolution

   Darwin had no knowledge of genetics, even though Mendel’s
   groundbreaking work on genetics was published during his lifetime. When
   genetics made its way into mainstream science, evolutionists adapted
   Darwin’s ideas to fit the emerging study of genetics, forming what is
   called the Modern Synthesis of Darwinian evolution, or neo-Darwinism.
   Most evolutionists today are adherents of neo-Darwinism to one extent
   or another. Neo-Darwinism emphasizes four major forces: gene flow,
   genetic drift, natural selection, and mutations. From these four
   forces, neo-Darwinists believe that they can explain the diversity of
   life on earth.

   Natural selection is the primary mover in the evolutionary dogma.
   Natural selection allows organisms that are best suited to their
   environment to survive and pass on their genetics with greater
   frequency. These organisms, because they are best suited for their
   environment, produce the most offspring. Over time, the traits of these
   organisms become dominant in a population. This is where mutations come
   in.

   evolutionists regard mutations as the force that creates new variation.
   While they acknowledge that mutations almost always remove genetic
   potential, they believe that on rare occasions a mutation will occur
   that can create an entirely new trait that is beneficial in a certain
   environment. Natural selection will then increase this trait in a
   population. Given enough time, and enough beneficial mutations,
   neo-Darwinists believe that one kind of organism can turn into another
   kind of organism—a fish can become a philosopher.

How Mutations Work in Real Life

   But the observable facts do not fit evolutionists’ dogma. Natural
   selection does happen, but it works just as Blyth envisioned it did: as
   a preservative, weeding out the worst mutations to preserve the health
   of a population. Scientists acknowledge natural selection is not the
   same as evolution. Mutations likewise occur, but most if not all
   mutations described as beneficial are only beneficial in certain, often
   unusual, situations.

   Antibiotic resistant bacteria is an often-cited example of evolution in
   action by means of mutation and natural selection. Antibiotic
   resistance already existed in bacterial populations before they were
   exposed to antibiotics. When artificial selection was applied in the
   form of antibiotics, the resistant ones survived. However, if there is
   no antibiotic present, resistant bacteria represent a tiny percentage
   of the population. This is because the way they avoid the antibiotic
   also results in them having a much harder time intaking nutrients. The
   mutation is only advantageous in a very specific circumstance, yet
   detrimental in a normal environment. God even created bacteria “after
   their kind” so they will always be bacteria.

No Increase in Genetic Information

   There is no known observable process by which new genetic information
   can be added to an organism’s genetic code, let alone how that
   information could arise from random chemicals in the first place.
   Information requires an intelligent source, since it requires not only
   data but also the ability to decode that data. This alone is enough to
   refute evolution because there’s no way for a fish to become an
   amphibian without new information.
   Origin of Life

The Origin of Life in Darwinian evolution

   Any ideas about how life could have started on earth overlook one
   important rule in biology: life doesn’t, cannot, and will never come
   from non-life. Life always comes from life. That’s the law—the law of
   biogenesis, to be exact. Scientists who try to simulate the origin of
   life really show how much intelligence is required for life to begin in
   the first place.

   While Darwin himself never addressed the origin of the universe and
   rarely touched on the origin of life, both are key aspects of
   evolutionary dogma. While many evolutionists attempt to distance
   themselves from these, particularly the origin-of-life question, both
   are fundamentally necessary for evolution to be true. Since most
   evolutionists insist on a naturalistic explanation for everything, the
   origin of life and origin of the universe are both fundamental
   questions evolutionists must answer to support their dogma and a
   naturalistic worldview.

   The origin-of-life question has troubled evolutionists for decades. In
   Darwin’s day, the internal workings of the cell were completely
   unknown. It was easy to speculate about the origin of something
   regarded simply as a tiny bag of slime. However, as we learned more
   about the intiricate workings of the cell, this became much more
   difficult.

   In the 1950s, a famous experiment at the University of Chicago known as
   the Miller-Urey experiment attempted to demonstrate the naturalistic
   origin of life. In the textbooks and headlines, they are said to have
   created the building blocks of life in a test tube. What they actually
   created was a toxic soup that included amino acids, which had to be
   removed from the reaction chamber before they were destroyed in a
   second pass. The experiment also deliberately excluded oxygen, as it
   would have destroyed their results. This experiment is still cited
   today as evidence of life from non-life, likely because all attempts to
   improve on the experiment have failed to produce even the basic
   structures needed for life.

The Fossil-Record Problem for evolution

   The fossil record is regularly trotted out as containing the finest
   examples of evolutionary changes in organisms. Yet within the
   evolutionist community itself, there was a massive schism in the 1970s
   when the late Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge proposed the idea of
   punctuated equilibrium. This idea acknowledged a virtual absence of
   transitional forms in the fossil record and proposed that evolution was
   not a gradual process. Instead, it was a jerky, jumpy process that
   mostly involved stasis before great leaps of change. While less common
   today with the influence of the dynamic Gould removed, the mere fact
   that this idea gained popularity attests to the lack of transitional
   forms in the fossil record.

   evolutionists prop up their dogma by claiming the earth is millions or
   even billions of years old. The most common proof of these great ages
   is radiometric dating. It is not carbon-14 dating, despite Hollywood
   being fixated on this dating method. Carbon-14 dating would only work
   on carbon-containing materials that are “only” a few tens of thousands
   of years old. Yet carbon-14 has been found in diamonds, which are
   supposedly billions of years old. It should be long gone, but it isn’t.

   Other forms of radiometric dating include uranium-lead dating,
   potassium-argon dating, rubidium-strontium dating and so on. All are
   governed by three basic assumptions. Scientists assume they know how
   much of both the parent and daughter element existed in the rock when
   it was formed. They assume that none of either the parent or daughter
   element was added or lost during the decay process.

   Finally, they assume that the rate of decay has been constant. None of
   these assumptions can be empirically proven. In fact, creationists have
   done radiometric testing on rocks of known ages, such as those formed
   in the Mount St. Helens eruption, and found that they dated at tens of
   thousands of years old despite being formed in 1980. Radiometric dating
   does not work as a reliable indicator of the age of the earth or its
   rocks.

   Very little of what evolutionists present as evidence for their dogma
   is good science. In fact, the mere idea of naturalistic evolution is
   anti-science. If evolution were true and if a random chance process
   created the world, then that same process of chance created the human
   brain and its powers of logic. If the brain and its use of logic came
   about by chance, why trust its conclusions? To be consistent,
   evolutionists should reject their own ability to reason logically. Of
   course if they did that, they would have to reject their own dogma as
   well, compelling them to accept a creator. evolution is a self-refuting
   religion.

   The types of changes evolution requires would be expected to provide
   many examples of missing links in virtually every layer of the geologic
   record. This is not the case. The geologic record is better explained
   by the global flood and the subsequent localized catastrophes after the
   flood.
   Christian Theology

evolution’s Effects on Christian Theology

   Unfortunately, as in Darwin’s day, much of the church has accepted
   millions of years and evolution as fact, without ever considering the
   underlying assumptions or how the acceptance of these assumptions
   undermines the biblical text and the gospel.

   For example, consider what happens when you attempt to add evolution
   into the Bible. Adam and Eve are no longer the first humans, and
   original sin goes out the window. This does irreparable damage to the
   biblical redemption narrative. The Bible says that death came into the
   world because of man’s sin (Romans 5:12) and that all of creation
   labors under a curse because of sin (Romans 8:22). Scripture also says
   that Christ is the last Adam, come to redeem us from the sin brought
   into the world through the first man, Adam (1 Corinthians 15:22, 45).
   If Adam were a mythical figure, which is what evolution demands, even
   in a Christianized form, the entire parallel between the two Adams and
   the kinsman redeemer concept is destroyed. By advocating evolution,
   theistic evolutionists are undermining the very tenets of Christianity.

   Those Christians who reject evolution but accept millions of years have
   an equivalent problem. Jesus, when explaining marriage to the
   Sadducees, referred to Adam and Eve as existing from the beginning of
   creation (Mark 10:6). According to those who accept millions of years,
   Adam and Eve only existed after billions and millions of years of
   death: this makes Jesus either ignorant or a liar. Further, when God
   finished his creation he called everything very good (Genesis 1:31). In
   order for the millions of years to be true, God would have to be
   calling the fossil record, which records disease, death, violence, and
   suffering, very good. That is inconsistent with the character of God
   revealed throughout the rest of Scripture.

   God tells us in Genesis exactly how he created the world, and even the
   order of events doesn’t match the evolutionary tale. In addition, one
   of the things that drives evolution is death. But the Bible teaches
   that death was introduced into the perfect world as a result of Adam’s
   sin. When Christians try to reinterpret God’s infallible Word based on
   the ideas of fallible men, it undermines the gospel of Jesus Christ.
   Answers For evolutionists

evolution and the Flood

   Further, attempting to combine evolution or millions of years with the
   biblical text forces Christians to reject the reality of the global
   flood of Noah’s day. If the fossil record was laid down before man,
   then the flood is not necessary to bury the fossils and, in fact,
   conflicts with the existing record. Therefore, according to these
   individuals, the flood had to be local or mythical. This raises all
   manner of questions such as; why did God not just tell Noah to move or
   how did a local flood cover all the mountains and yet remain local? The
   only way to get around these questions is to torture the Hebrew text
   and the concept of biblical inerrancy.

   evolution, whether couched in Christianized language or presented in
   its natural atheistic colors, remains an utterly bankrupt and failed
   hypothesis about the origin of the universe or the diversity of life on
   earth. In no instance has cosmological, geological, or biological
   evolution been demonstrated, and the most common evidences for
   evolution all have been debunked. Attempting to add evolution to
   Christianity is both unbiblical and irrational, since evolution itself
   is not science but anti-science. Neither the Bible nor empirical
   science support its claims.

evolution Requires Faith

   For many, a belief in evolution comes from the desire to remove the
   need for God as Creator. Some would say evolution comes from what the
   evidence says to us. But evidence never speaks for itself, it’s always
   interpreted using your assumptions and starting points. And only when
   you examine the evidence through the lens of the Bible does it makes
   sense.

   evolution is rooted in the belief system of naturalism that doesn’t
   allow for anything outside the laws of nature to explain how our world
   operates. Ironically, naturalism requires the violation of several
   known laws of the universe.

     * The law of biogenesis (life only comes from life)
     * The uniformity of nature (uniformity cannot exist or be expected
       without a creator)
     * The laws of physics (the big bang requires the suspension of the
       laws of physics, nor could those laws exist without a creator)
     * The laws of probability (the fine tuning of the universe requires a
       creator)
     * The laws of logic (logic requires a logical source)
     * The laws of chemistry (the consistent properties of the elements
       require intelligence)
     * The laws of information (information can only come from an
       intelligence)

   To accept that all of these things truly operate in the world without
   God as their Creator and Organizer requires an immense amount of faith.
   While it is often used as a criticism of Christians, those who have an
   evolutionary worldview must accept all of these things by blind faith
   since there is no naturalistic explanation for the existence of these
   laws. While Christians also accept certain truths by faith, it is faith
   in the Creator and Lawgiver who provides a basis for those truths, not
   a blind faith in blind, chance processes.

Myths About evolution

     * “98% similarity” between human and chimp DNA
       This difference actually represents millions of letters of
       difference and many differences are not represented in the “98%
       similarity.” This is actually strong evidence for a common
       Designer, who used common building blocks in his design but gave
       humanity characteristics unlike any other creature he made.
     * “Ape-men”
       The pervasive ape-to-human montage and other "reconstructions" are
       just artwork based on imagination, wishful thinking, and
       presuppositional influence. All the supposed ape-men can be
       classified as either human or ape, not transitional forms.
     * Bad Design
       Some structures seem to show less-than-optimal design, and to some
       evolutionists this proves there is no creator. But a universe that
       has been cursed with degeneration for over 6,000 years won't
       maintain optimal design. The fact that we continue to survive is
       evidence of how good the original design was.
     * Vestigial Organs and Junk DNA
       evolutionists claim that humans and other animals have organs and
       DNA leftover from evolution. But these reports are often based on
       evolutionary expectations. The appendix, for example, was once
       thought vestigial, but now we know its function. Even a true loss
       of function shows a world that is in decay, which is exactly what
       the Bible says.
     * All Scientists Agree
       Even if every single person accepted an idea, that doesn’t make the
       idea correct. Many embrace evolution because they won’t allow for
       anything miraculous or supernatural. But there are a growing number
       of scientists, creationist and not, who do not find the supposed
       evidence for evolution to be valid or convincing.
     * Similarities Show Past evolutionary Connections
       Similarities in anatomy supposedly prove descent from a common
       ancestor. But structures that appear similar (homologous) often
       develop under the control of genes that are not homologous. There
       is another logical reason why things look alike—creation by an
       intelligent designer using a common blueprint.

Life-Changing Answers for evolutionists

   There are numerous anatomical structures that are clearly designed.
   Many are irreducibly complex, meaning the parts serve no benefit unless
   they all exist and are working together. There are many such examples
   of design in biology. All of these point to an intelligent Creator and
   Designer.

   So we’re left with an inescapable conclusion: there must be a powerful
   and super-wise Creator. With such a Creator, you no longer need
   billions of years. He could create everything in much less
   time—say . . . six days. This Creator gave us a clear record (the
   Bible) of how he created the world, how long it took him, how humans
   fell into sin, and how God the Son (Jesus) came to earth to save us
   from our sinful rebellion against him.

   Since we can trust the Bible’s history and science, we can also trust
   what it says about Jesus Christ, God’s Son, and why he came. Keep

Darwin and His Theory of evolution

   At first glance, Charles Darwin seems an unlikely revolutionary.
   Growing up a shy and unassuming member of a wealthy British family, he
   appeared, at least to his father, to be idle and directionless. But
   even as a child, Darwin expressed an interest in nature. Later, while
   studying botany at Cambridge University, he was offered a chance to
   work as an unpaid naturalist on the HMS Beagle, a naval vessel
   embarking on an exploratory voyage around the world. In the course of
   nearly five years at sea – during which time the Beagle surveyed the
   coast of South America and stopped in such places as Australia and,
   most famously, the Galapagos Islands – Darwin took advantage of
   countless opportunities to observe plant and animal life and to collect
   both living and fossilized specimens for later study.

   After the Beagle returned to England in October 1836, Darwin began
   reflecting on his observations and experiences, and over the next two
   years developed the basic outline of his groundbreaking theory of
   evolution through natural selection. But beyond sharing his ideas with
   a close circle of scientist friends, Darwin told no one of his views on
   the origin and development of life. Indeed, he did not publish his
   now-famous volume, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural
   Selection, until 1859, more than 20 years after he had first formulated
   his theory.

   On the Origin of Species may never have been written, let alone
   published, if it had not been for Alfred Russel Wallace, another
   British naturalist who independently proposed a strikingly similar
   theory in 1858. Wallace’s announcement prompted Darwin to publicly
   reveal that his own research had led him to the same conclusion decades
   earlier. This being the age of Victorian gentlemen, it was agreed that
   the two scientists would jointly publish their writings on the subject.
   Their work – comprising a collection of Darwin’s earlier notes and an
   essay by Wallace – was read to the Linnean Society, an association of
   naturalists, in London on July 1, 1858. The following year, Darwin
   published On the Origin of Species, a lengthy, fleshed-out treatment of
   his ideas on evolutionary theory. The book was an immediate bestseller
   and quickly set off a firestorm of controversy.

   Darwin had expected no less – fear of a backlash from Britain’s
   religious and even scientific establishment had been the primary reason
   he had delayed publicizing his ideas. Yet the concept of species
   adaptation was not so radical at the time. Scientists had been debating
   whether animals evolved decades before Darwin put forth his theory. The
   idea of “transmutation of species” had been rejected by many prominent
   naturalists, among them French scientist Georges Cuvier, who believed
   that species had been created much as they appeared in his day. But
   transmutation also had early champions, including Darwin’s grandfather,
   the famed Birmingham physician Erasmus Darwin.

   The younger Darwin’s achievement was to offer a plausible and
   compelling explanation for how species evolve and to use this
   explanation to trace the history of life’s development. All existing
   creatures, he argued, descended from a small number of original or
   progenitor species. Darwin compared the history of life to a great
   tree, its trunk representing these few common ancestors and an
   extensive system of branches and twigs symbolizing the great variety of
   life that has evolved from them.

   This evolution, Darwin wrote, is due to two factors. The first factor,
   Darwin argued, is that each individual animal is marked by subtle
   differences that distinguish it from its parents. Darwin, who called
   these differences “variations,” understood their effect but not their
   cause; the idea of genetic mutation, and indeed the scientific study of
   genetics, would not arise fully until the early 20th century. The
   second factor, Darwin argued, is that although variations are random,
   some of them convey distinct advantages – superior camouflage, a
   heartier constitution or greater speed, for example – that better equip
   a creature to survive in its environment. A greater chance of survival
   allows for more opportunity to breed and pass on advantageous traits to
   a greater number of offspring. Over time, an advantage spreads
   throughout a species; in turn, the species is more likely to endure and
   reproduce. Thus, over the course of many generations, subtle changes
   occur and accumulate, eventually morphing into bigger changes and,
   possibly, even a new species.

   While Darwin’s ideas initially challenged long-held scientific and
   religious belief systems, opposition to much of Darwin’s thinking among
   the scientific communities of the English-speaking world largely
   collapsed in the decades following the publication of On the Origin of
   Species. Yet evolution continued to be vigorously rejected by British
   and American churches because, religious leaders argued, the theory
   directly contradicted many of the core teachings of the Christian
   faith.

   Darwin’s notion that existing species, including man, had developed
   over time due to constant and random change seemed to be in clear
   opposition to the idea that all creatures had been created “according
   to their kind” by God, as described in the first chapter of the
   biblical book of Genesis. Before Darwin, the prevailing scientific
   theory of life’s origins and development had held that species were
   fixed and that they never changed. This theory, known as “special
   creationism,” comported well with the biblical account of God creating
   the fish, fowl and mammals without mention of subsequent alteration.

   Darwinian thinking also appeared to contradict the notion, central to
   Christianity and many other faiths, that man had a special, God-given
   place in the natural order. Instead, proponents of evolution pointed to
   signs in human anatomy – remnants of a tailbone, for instance – showing
   common ancestry with other mammals.

   Finally, the idea of a benevolent God who cared for his creation was
   seemingly challenged by Darwin’s depiction of the natural world as a
   savage and cruel place – “red in tooth and claw,” as Darwin’s
   contemporary, Alfred Lord Tennyson, wrote just a few years before On
   the Origin of Species was published. Darwin’s theory challenged the
   idea that the natural world existed in benevolent harmony.

   Darwin fully understood, and at times agonized over, the threat that
   his work might pose to traditional religious belief, explaining in an
   1860 letter to American botanist Asa Gray that he “had no intention to
   write atheistically.” But, he went on, “I cannot see as plainly as
   others do … evidence of design and beneficence on all sides of us.
   There seems to be too much misery in the world.”

   Regardless of his intentions, Darwin’s ideas provoked a harsh and
   immediate response from religious leaders in Britain. For instance,
   England’s highest-ranking Catholic official, Henry Cardinal Manning,
   denounced Darwin’s views as “a brutal philosophy – to wit, there is no
   God, and the ape is our Adam.” Samuel Wilberforce, the Anglican
   Archbishop of Oxford and one of the most highly respected religious
   leaders in 19th-century England, also condemned natural selection in a
   now-famous speech on what he deemed the theory’s scientific
   deficiencies at an 1860 meeting of the British Association for the
   Advancement of Science. At one point during the meeting, Wilberforce
   reportedly asked biologist Thomas Henry Huxley whether he was related
   to an ape on his grandmother’s or grandfather’s side. Huxley, whose
   vigorous defense of evolutionary theory would earn him the nickname
   “Darwin’s bulldog,” allegedly replied that he would rather be the
   ancestor of a monkey than an advanced and intelligent human being who
   employed his “knowledge and eloquence in misrepresenting those who are
   wearing out their lives in the search for truth.”

   Some scholars now contend that Huxley’s rebuke of Wilberforce never
   occurred. Regardless, it was around this time that the British
   scientific establishment gained the upper hand in the debate over
   evolution. And while the public disagreement between ecclesiastical and
   scientific authorities did not end in the 1860s, religious thinkers
   became more wary of directly challenging evolution on scientific
   grounds. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, churches instead
   focused much of their energy on resisting the idea that man had evolved
   from lower animal orders and hence had no special place in creation or,
   for that matter, a soul. Indeed, while some churches, including the
   Catholic Church, eventually accepted evolution as a God-directed
   mechanism of biological development, none questioned the role of God as
   the sole creator of man.

   By the time of his death, in 1882, Darwin was considered the greatest
   scientist of his age. Moreover, the very church his theory had
   challenged accorded him a full state funeral and burial in Westminster
   Abbey, near the grave of Sir Isaac Newton. Darwin’s idea was still
   provocative, but by the time of his death it had gained general
   acceptance in Britain, even among many in the Anglican clergy. Indeed,
   his interment in the abbey was seen by some contemporaries as symbolic
   of an uneasy truce between science and religion in Britain.

The origin and evolution of woolly rhinoceros in the view of ancient DNA

   Woolly rhinoceros is one of the most popular species of the Ice Age,
   which has been attracting great interests from both the scientific
   community and the public. In recent years, technical advances in
   ancient DNA have provided powerful tools for exploring the evolution of
   this extinct star species.

   Ancient mitogenomes reveal a high maternal genetic diversity of
   Pleistocene woolly rhinoceros in Northern China - BMC Ecology and
   evolution

   Background Woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) is a typical
   indicator of cold-stage climate that was widely distributed in Northern
   Hemisphere during the Middle-Late Pleistocene. Although a plethora of
   fossils have been excavated from Northern China, their phylogenetic
   status, intraspecific diversity and phylogeographical structure are
   still vague. Results In the present study, we generated four
   mitogenomes from Late Pleistocene woolly rhinoceros in Northern China
   and compared them with published data. Bayesian and network analyses
   indicate that the analyzed individuals contain at least four maternal
   haplogroups, and Chinese samples fall in three of them. One of our
   samples belongs to a previously unidentified early diverging clade
   (haplogroup D), which separated from other woolly rhinoceros around
   0.57 Ma (95% CI: 0.76–0.41 Ma). The timing of this clade’s origin
   coincides with the first occurrence of woolly rhinoceros, which are
   thought to have evolved in Europe. Our other three samples cluster in
   haplogroup C, previously only identified from one specimen from Wrangel
   Island (ND030) and initially considered to be an isolated clade.
   Herein, our findings suggest that ND030 is likely descended from a
   northward dispersal of the individuals carrying haplogroup C from
   Northern China. Additionally, Chinese woolly rhinoceros specimens
   exhibit higher nucleotide diversity than those from Siberia. Conclusion
   Our findings highlight Northern China as a possible refugium and a key
   evolution center of the Pleistocene woolly rhinoceros.

   The rhino family once evolved into at least 100 species, inhabited from
   Africa across Eurasia to America, while only five critically endangered
   species surviving at present. Among the extinct rhino species, woolly
   rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) is the most well-known one, which
   became extinct at the end of the Late Pleistocene. Woolly rhinoceros is
   an advanced species of the genus Coelodonta. The earliest
   representative of this genus, Coelodonta thibetana (~3.7 million years
   ago, Ma), originated in Qing-Tibetan Plateau, Southwestern China, then
   gradually evolved into different cold-adapt forms in Northern China
   since the start of Ice Age. Woolly rhinoceros is generally suggested as
   a typical indicator taxa of cold environments, and once widely
   distributed in Northern Eurasia during the Late Pleistocene. Unlike
   mammoth, it failed to cross the Bering Land Bridge from Eurasia into
   North America.

   Northern China is famous for “Mammuthus-Coelodonta faunas” during the
   Late Pleistocene, and abundant woolly rhinoceros fossil materials have
   been excavated from the Late Pleistocene strata in this region. Given
   the early members of the genus Coelodonta originated in Northern China
   and numerous woolly rhinoceros remains excavated in this region,
   Northern China holds a crucial importance in the evolutionary history
   of this genus. Paleontologists carried out a series of exploration on
   fossil materials of Coelodonta in terms of morphological analyses, and
   previously proposed that Chinese woolly rhinoceros possibly descended
   from its Siberian relatives.

   important fossil localities of “Mammuthus-Coelodonta faunas” in China.

   In recent years, the rapid development of ancient DNA technologies,
   especially the metagenomic technology, have greatly increased the
   length of obtained sequences, making it possible to retrieve whole
   genomes from fossil materials. Until present, the outcomes of
   paleogenomic studies have fundamentally changed our understanding of
   the evolutionary history of many extinct/extant species. Especially,
   woolly mammoth, as one of the iconic members of
   “Mammuthus-Coelodonta faunas”, has become a model species for ancient
   DNA study due to its widespread distribution in Northern Hemisphere,
   while woolly rhinoceroses has received far less attention in the
   molecular level.

   Our team has been dedicated to DNA studies of
   Chinese Pleistocene-Holocene vertebrates over the past two decades,
   trying to explore the evolutionary history of the analyzed populations.
   We have focused on members of “Mammuthus-Coelodonta faunas” from
   Northern China, such as woolly mammoth, straight-tusked elephant,
   steppe bison, Ovodov horse, Przewalski׳s horse, red deer, roe deer,
   tiger, and cave hyenas as well. Molecular studies suggested several
   ancient Chinese populations showed close relationship to their Siberian
   relatives. With regards to woolly rhinoceros, where did the Chinese
   woolly rhinoceros come from? What is the exact phylogenetic status of
   the Chinese woolly rhinoceros from a genetic perspective? How about the
   genetic diversity level of Chinese individuals? To figure out problem
   solving possibilities, we carried out ancient DNA study on Chinese
   woolly rhinoceros individuals at about ten years ago. Unfortunately,
   only several fragment sequences were obtained from the analyzed samples
   at that time. However, the initial results and context of our previous
   ancient DNA studies on other Pleistocene mammals greatly sparked our
   interest in studying the genetic evolution of woolly rhinoceros.

   proportion of woolly rhinoceros fossils from the Late Pleistocene
   strata in this region. Credit: Taogetongqimuge

   With help of our collaborators, we collected Late Pleistocene woolly
   rhinoceros remains from seven locations distributed in Northern China.
   We reconstructed the maternal phylogenetic trees based on the newly
   obtained mitochondrial genomes and previous published data using
   Bayesian and network analyses. Surprisingly, we found three Chinese
   samples cluster with one Wrangel Island sample and form a distinct
   maternal clade that previously proposed as an isolated lineage. Another
   surprise comes from the appearance of the oldest mitochondrial lineage
   of woolly rhinoceroses in Inner Mongolia, China. Moreover, the Late
   Pleistocene woolly rhinoceros individuals in Northern China have
   relatively high maternal genetic diversity compared with their Siberian
   relatives.

   known habitat of the basal woolly rhinoceros lineage. Credit: Longmei

   In summary, our new genetic data not only indicates the surprising
   result that Northern China could be an important evolutionary center
   for woolly rhinoceroses during the Pleistocene, but also suggests that
   this famous extinct rhino possibly originated in this region rather
   than in Europe that derived from fossil records. Although our
   preliminary study has only uncovered the tip of the iceberg on the
   evolutionary history of this rhino species, our findings herein
   highlight that ancient DNA sequences from Chinese individuals are very
   important for revealing the full picture of the evolution of woolly
   rhinoceros, which will also have the enlightenment significance for
   exploring the evolutionary history of the other members of
   “Mammuthus-Coelodonta faunas” under the influence of global climate and
   environmental changes in Quaternary.

   86% of the 28,000 species at risk of extinction. To protect, restore
   and promote biodiversity, there is an increasing need to transition
   towards more sustainable and resilient agri-food systems. To highlight
   this issue and support the United Nation’s Sustainable Development

Abstract

   evolution is both a fact and a theory. evolution is widely observable
   in laboratory and natural populations as they change over time. The
   fact that we need annual flu vaccines is one example of observable
   evolution. At the same time, evolutionary theory explains more than
   observations, as the succession on the fossil record. Hence, evolution
   is also the scientific theory that embodies biology, including all
   organisms and their characteristics. In this paper, we emphasize why
   evolution is the most important theory in biology. evolution explains
   every biological detail, similar to how history explains many aspects
   of a current political situation. Only evolution explains the patterns
   observed in the fossil record. Examples include the succession in the
   fossil record; we cannot find the easily fossilized mammals before 300
   million years ago; after the extinction of the dinosaurs, the fossil
   record indicates that mammals and birds radiated throughout the planet.
   Additionally, the fact that we are able to construct fairly consistent
   phylogenetic trees using distinct genetic markers in the genome is only
   explained by evolutionary theory. Finally, we show that the processes
   that drive evolution, both on short and long time scales, are
   observable facts.

   In recent years, the teaching of creationism within science curricula
   has become a subject of public debate worldwide (Miller et al., 2006;
   Reiss 2011). Most of the attention has been given to cases in the
   United States of America (Jackson et al., 1995; Berkman and Plutzer,
   2011; Baltzley, 2016; Ross, 2017), where many bills have been submitted
   to the Houses of Representatives encouraging teachers to express their
   criticism about evolution. In more serious cases, such as Turkey,
   evolution has recently been removed from the high school curriculum
   (Kingsley, 2017), and in Brazil, intelligent design research has
   recently reached university level (Silva, 2017). The rise of
   “anti-vaxxers” and “flat-earthers” openly demonstrates that the
   anti-science movement is not confined to biology, with devastating
   consequences such as the vaccine-preventable outbreaks (Miller et al.,
   2015). At the same time, the anti-science debates have been usually
   promoted by anti-scientists and have stayed marginal to scientific
   literature. This explains the rising trend and confirms the need for
   scientists to hastily step into the scene. With this in mind, we felt
   compelled to address basic aspects of science and of the scientific
   method in the evolution versus divine creation debate in a scientific
   journal.

   Science can be defined as being both the criterion for gathering
   scientific data (scientific method), as well as the explanatory
   theories that were developed following its criteria (scientific
   knowledge) (Project 2061 American Association for the Advancement of
   Science, 1993; Roberts 2007). A few centuries ago, scientists decided
   to select a small part of human knowledge to restrict the method used
   to assemble this knowledge. The use of the scientific method does not
   mean that this is more valuable than other types of knowledge; it is
   just more reliable in uncovering natural laws (Atkins, 1995).

   One should regard science as a process in which scientists formulate
   hypotheses to explain certain facts and to test their predictive models
   by confronting their predictions with new facts (Gilbert, 1991). A fact
   is something that we observe. For instance, when we drop an object, it
   falls to the ground. This is a fact. The scientific theory that
   explains why objects fall is the theory of gravity. A valid scientific
   theory can never become a fact (Gould, 1981), as there is always the
   possibility that a future explanation will better match newly
   discovered facts.

evolution as a fact and theory

   evolution is a population concept. An individual does not evolve; only
   populations evolve in the face of the genetic changes accumulated from
   one generation to the next. The flu virus evolves. This explains why
   last years’ flu vaccine does not work on the current strain of the
   virus: only the resistant strains of the virus survived last year’s
   vaccine application. This is a textbook example of evolution by natural
   selection. Genetic modifications are encountered in the resistant
   strains; thus, evolution is a fact (Gould, 1981). Mutation, migration,
   natural selection, and genetic drift are the evolutionary forces that
   drive genetic changes of natural populations from one generation to the
   next. This is known among biologists as microevolution.

   On the other hand, evolutionary theory explains more than those facts
   that we can routinely observe. This makes it a theory, but is it just a
   theory? The word theory has distinct meanings in science and in lay
   language (Ghose, 2013). A scientific theory is the utmost position an
   idea may reach in science. Outside of academia, however, a theory is
   equivalent to a hypothesis, an idea that explains facts but has never
   been tested (Futuyama and Kirkpatrick, 2017). This occurs because there
   seems to be no need for a distinction between hypothesis and theory
   outside the scope of science. In science, however, this distinction is
   fundamental. An idea remains a hypothesis if it has never been
   confronted with new (independently collected) scientific data that
   would serve as a test for its predictions. If a hypothesis has endured
   further testing by subsequent scientific experiments, in time it
   becomes a valid scientific theory (Figure 1).

   Figure 1
   The flow chart illustrates the difference between a scientific
   hypothesis and a scientific theory. A theory is the highest place an
   explanation for facts may reach in science.

   For any given valid scientific theory there are three possibilities.
   The first possibility is that the true explanation for the facts is
   entirely different from the valid scientific theory. In this case, all
   scientific experiments aimed to test the theory were flawed in design
   or in the interpretation of the results. The second possibility is that
   the true explanation for the facts is more restricted than the current
   scientific theory claims. In this case, the predictions of the theory
   agreed with newly collected data because all tests focused on a single
   (and true) aspect of the theory. Finally, the last alternative is that
   the true explanation for the facts is the scientific theory. Science
   has the tools to reject (first alternative) and to refine (second
   alternative) scientific theories when they are confronted with new
   data. However, even theories that endure many tests must still face
   these three possibilities, as, even in light of the true explanation,
   science does not furnish us the tools to perceive truthfulness.

   A hallmark of natural sciences is that scientific hypotheses and
   scientific theories must make predictions about the natural world
   (Paz-y-Miño and Spinosa, 2011). Often, the older the theory, the more
   reliable it is because it has survived many empirical tests.
   Furthermore, the more universal the theory, the more robust it becomes
   with time, as more tests would have been performed. According to
   Darwin, evolutionary theory is centred around two points (Darwin,
   1859). First, from one generation to the next, natural populations
   change over time by a process of natural selection. Second, all
   organisms have a common ancestor, and the time since this last common
   ancestor lived is inversely proportional to the similarities that the
   organisms will share today. Hence, evolutionary theory is universal
   because it includes all (living and fossil) biological diversity and
   has implications for all heritable characteristics of life. Since 1859,
   evolutionary theory has become the most universal and, hence, widely
   tested of the scientific theories in biology.

   Today, Darwin’s original theory has been refined, as he himself
   anticipated that it would be (Darwin, 1871). This occurred in many
   fronts because recent concepts, such as genetic drift and mutations,
   have provided more details on how natural populations evolve. One
   example is the understanding that, at the molecular level, random
   evolution, rather than natural selection, plays the most important role
   (Kimura, 1991). This is known as the neutral theory, which completed
   its 50^th anniversary in 2018.

   The substance of Darwin’s original theory, however, remains. Theodosius
   Dobzhansky (1973) shared his astonishment that Charles Darwin proposed
   the theory of evolution without many key biological concepts, such as
   that DNA is the molecule responsible for heredity. Half a century after
   Dobzhansky’s paper, it remains impressive that the theory of evolution
   still stands valid in light of the discoveries of the molecular biology
   revolution. Each newly sequenced genome tests some aspects of Darwin’s
   theory, and, on each case, the sequence has been consistent with
   Darwin’s prediction of the shared evolutionary history of life. The
   sharp increase in scope and universality of evolution has strengthened
   Darwin’s original proposal and made evolutionary theory one of the most
   reliable and tested theories in the natural sciences (National Academy
   of Sciences, 2008).

   Some creationists dispute this information, claiming that scientists
   discredit data that go against evolutionary theory. Nonetheless, there
   is no room for considering worldwide, long-lasting conspiracies in
   science, as scientific fame and recognition come from the demolition of
   old theories, not from adherence to them (Atkins, 1995). Indeed,
   scientists themselves have challenged many aspects of the original
   Darwinian theory of evolution, such as the importance of neutral
   evolution, the discovery of epigenetics, the proposal of punctuated
   equilibrium, etc. When these challenges were first proposed, they were
   not ignored; they were published in top scientific journals and have
   been subject to meticulous research and have generated fruitful debates
   in the scientific arena.

   Furthermore, if scientists were dishonestly accepting a false theory of
   evolution, Lamarck’s theory of inheritance of acquired characters would
   still be considered valid today. However, it is not. In the XIX
   century, August Weissman (1889) removed the tails of 20 generations of
   mice, but no significant decrease in length was found in the
   descendants’ tails. Scientists themselves devised the scientific
   experiment that bluntly rejected Lamarck’s proposal as a mechanism of
   evolution (Dobzhansky, 1973). Scientists do not discredit data that
   goes against evolution; otherwise, Lamarck’s idea would still be
   accepted. They discredit scientific untestable theories and
   explanations that were not gathered using the scientific method.

The cornerstone of biology

   Just as human history explains the geopolitical configurations of our
   world today, modern biological systems are a direct result of their
   evolutionary past. Hence, evolutionary theory is the cornerstone of the
   discipline of biology (Rutledge and Warden, 2000). The discipline of
   biology today is an instantaneous portrayal of the dynamic evolutionary
   axis that arose with the origin of life and has been changing by
   evolution ever since (Figure 2). With the first life, genetics,
   ecology, biochemistry and evolution began.

   Figure 2
   The relationship between evolution and biology. Ever since the origin
   of life, evolutionary processes, such as mutation, selection, and
   genetic drift, are responsible for genetic change in natural and
   laboratory populations. Hence, biology is an instantaneous snap-shot of
   the dynamic evolutionary axis. This simplified figure illustrates some,
   of the many, faunal explosions that have took place since the origin of
   life.

   As a scientific theory, however, which facts does evolutionary theory
   explain? One pivotal example is the succession in the fossil record.
   This evolution, namely, macroevolution, explains the larger
   evolutionary picture that is the appearance of the greater groups, such
   as the evolution of mammals, insects, and plants. Fossilized mammals
   are easily recognized, as they have distinct types of teeth, such as
   molars, canines, and incisors. These vertebrates are also very likely
   to fossilize on account of their rigid teeth and hard cranium. If
   mammals are so easily fossilized, how can we explain a rich fossil
   record full of vertebrates and invertebrates with no mammalian fossil
   before 300 million years ago?

   Similarly, if we dig deeper still, disclosing 500 million years old
   layers, we find no hard skeleton vertebrates but plenty of fossilized
   invertebrates in a boost of diversity that we call the Cambrian
   Explosion. There are no vertebrates in this explosion because
   vertebrates appear in a much later explosion. Digging even deeper, to
   600 million years old records, we find strata with soft-bodied
   Ediacaran animals but no hard-shelled invertebrates and no vertebrates.
   In one billion years old strata, we find only single-celled organisms.

   How can we find, in old strata, many single celled organisms but not a
   single mammalian tooth? The only reasonable explanation for these facts
   is that 400 million years ago, mammals had not yet evolved; 500 million
   years ago, vertebrates had not yet evolved; 600 million years ago,
   hard-shelled invertebrates had not yet evolved; and one billion years
   ago, multicellular life had not yet evolved. Smaller local successions
   are also observable in the fossil record; such as the beautiful strings
   of intermediate fossils that include amphibians (Kustchera and Elliot,
   2013), birds, whales (Thewissen, 2009), horses, and humans. These
   successions in the fossil record are the most obvious evidence to
   macroevolution (Figure 2). In fact, the entire fossil record is a set
   of millions of intermediate fossils that provide solid evidence of how
   macroevolution worked in the past billion years.

evolutionary processes that drive micro and macroevolution are facts

   To have a better understanding of evolution, we must discuss the
   processes that drive evolution. For this, we start by comparing
   processes that drive microevolution with those that drive
   macroevolution. Many of the same evolutionary processes that drive
   microevolution also drive macroevolution, namely natural selection,
   mutation, migration, and genetic drift. A lineage will tend to
   diversify if it has adaptations that increase survival and reproductive
   abilities compared to other species. This advantage will tend to
   increase population size and the geographical distribution of the
   ancestral species that will more likely speciate into two descendant
   species. Hence, according to this view, macroevolution is
   microevolution on a larger scale (Zimmer, 2001), with biological
   speciation as the only additional process (Russo et al., 2016). Through
   speciation, one ancestral species gives rise to two descendant species
   that are reproductively incompatible with each other.

   More than a million species have been described (Mora et al., 2011),
   and each biological species includes many interbreeding members. Also,
   most species are reproductively isolated from each other. The fact that
   we observe biological species with interbreeding members and
   reproductive isolation between species is compatible with both separate
   creation and macroevolution. So, which observable pattern would we
   expect if many speciation events generated the vast biological
   diversity from a single common ancestor? In this case, we would expect
   different degrees of similarity between reproductively isolated
   species. This is exactly what we observe. Some species are very
   similar, such as chimpanzees and gorillas, with most features shared
   between them. Other species, on the other hand, are morphologically so
   different that one must look into cytology, physiology, or comparative
   genomics to detect evidence of their common past. One example is a fern
   and a frog. For instance, the cellular respiration is a process shared
   by ferns and frogs and it is an evidence of their common ancestry. Only
   macroevolution explains well the distinct degrees of similarity between
   these four isolated species, as the age of their last common ancestor
   is inversely proportional to the similarity between any two species.

   Furthermore, the existence of hybrids, such as the mule, the liger, the
   coywolf, is also only explained by the hierarchical common ancestry
   theory, not by separate creation. The hybrids are direct evidence of
   on-going processes of speciation. Thus, the presence of hybrids is what
   we would expect if all life had a common ancestry.

   Other fossil record patterns are well explained by macroevolution. For
   instance, why do we find a major increase in mammalian fossil diversity
   only after the disappearance of non-avian dinosaurs approximately 65
   million years ago? The same pattern is observed in the fossil record of
   birds. Macroevolution explains this well, as the extinction of
   dinosaurs eliminated competition, and the surviving ancestral mammals
   were able to increase in number and diversified through speciation,
   generating more species of their kind.

Final remarks

   A single, very well designed experiment, performed in accordance with
   the utmost scientific standards, is what it takes to put any scientific
   theory to rest. Divine creation will never be part of science because
   science is not able to detect supernatural phenomena. Divine phenomena
   explain everything equally; hence, it provides no real explanatory
   (i.e., predictive) power. If we accept “God’s will” as an adequate
   explanation for a natural phenomenon, we eliminate the possibility of
   eventually being able to explain it naturally. Thus, the scientific
   revolution begun when we eliminated the divine as a scientific
   explanation.

   Science, as a process, starts with the acceptance of our ignorance
   about a natural phenomenon and by seeking natural explanations for it.
   Hence, ignorance drives the engine of Science. Even if evolution were,
   hypothetically, rejected, contested by new data, scientists would have
   to study hard to find an alternative natural explanation that was able
   to explain everything that evolution explains today plus the new data
   that contested it.

   evolution is a fact and a well-supported scientific theory. It has
   endured daily and rigorous testing, and it stands as the unifying
   theory in biology (Rutledge and Warden, 2000). This says nothing about
   whether God created or did not create the world, as science is unable
   to distinguish a divinely guided evolution from a materialistic
   evolution. God may well have created the biological world through
   natural selection, mutation, speciation, extinction, etc. Still,
   evolution and Science would remain unscathed as Science is not
   concerned with why or who, but only with how.

   Some creationists say that we must bring the evolution versus
   creationist debate to the classroom and claim that the opposition to
   the debate is anti-scientific. However, science is not about blind
   criticism (Meyer and El-Hani, 2013). Blind criticism is just as naïve
   as blind acceptance. Scientists must weigh the evidence before
   questioning a theory. The idea that all debates are equally scientific
   is misleading and it explains the sad emergence of flat-earthers and
   anti-vaxxers. A debate on what is the shape of our planet is not only
   pointless, but it is also dangerously harmful to the minds of the young
   students. A fruitful debate in a science class is restricted to those
   issues that lie within the scientific realm (Baltzley, 2016, Branch,
   2016).

   A recent study has suggested that science concepts, more than
   evolutionary basics, are critical to promoting evolution (Dunk et al.,
   2017). One way to reinforce these fundamentals would be the requirement
   of evolution and science fundaments in admission policies for biology
   professionals, particularly teachers (Larkin and Perry-Ryder, 2015; see
   Rutledge and Warden, 2000 for statistics).

Abstract

   Cultural evolution theory has long been inspired by evolutionary
   biology. Conceptual analogies between biological and cultural evolution
   have led to the adoption of a range of formal theoretical approaches
   from population dynamics and genetics. However, this has resulted in a
   research programme with a strong focus on cultural transmission. Here,
   we contrast biological with cultural evolution, and highlight aspects
   of cultural evolution that have not received sufficient attention
   previously. We outline possible implications for evolutionary dynamics
   and argue that not taking them into account will limit our
   understanding of cultural systems. We propose 12 key questions for
   future research, among which are calls to improve our understanding of
   the combinatorial properties of cultural innovation, and the role of
   development and life history in cultural dynamics. Finally, we discuss
   how this vibrant research field can make progress by embracing its
   multidisciplinary nature.

   This article is part of the theme issue ‘Foundations of cultural
   evolution’.

1.  Introduction

   Culture is one of the most complex collective phenomena we know. The
   capacity of our species to produce and accumulate culture (i.e. the
   collection of socially transmitted attitudes, beliefs, knowledge,
   skills, technologies, values, etc.) has allowed us to inhabit virtually
   every part of the planet, making culture a cornerstone to the
   ecological success of our species (e.g. [1,2]). Moreover, no other
   species produce as many different and complex cultural products and is
   undoubtedly as reliant on them as we are [2,3]. As such, the study of
   culture and how it changes has been central to the research programme
   of many disciplines, from the humanities and social sciences to the
   natural sciences.

   To better understand the origin and nature of culture, how culture
   emerges and changes over time, why some aspects of culture change
   continuously or abruptly while others remain relatively unchanged, or
   why sometimes neighbouring groups differ and distant groups share
   certain cultural practices, there has been a centuries-long effort to
   devise or formulate a general theory of culture. One such approach is
   the application of evolutionary theory to culture. Inspired by Darwin’s
   publication ‘On the Origin of Species’ [4], the idea of taking an
   evolutionary perspective on (human) culture has received considerable
   research interest from scholars in many fields. The popularity of using
   evolutionary terminology when describing cultural change, however, has
   varied considerably over time (for overviews of evolutionary thinking
   in the humanities and social sciences, see [5–10]). This was in part
   due to a lack of understanding of biological evolution but also based
   on the politically motivated misuse of evolutionary theory (see [11]).

   A more recent approach to studying cultural evolution was inspired by
   the quantitative theories that emerged in the life sciences in the
   first half of the twentieth century. They were the direct result of
   major advances in the understanding of the evolutionary process, marked
   by the Modern Synthesis that unified Darwinian evolution with Mendelian
   genetics. These novel formal descriptions of biological transmission
   greatly increased the understanding of biological evolution. The
   theoretical models by Fisher [12], Wright [13] and Haldane [14] cast
   verbal theories and thought experiments in the precise language of
   mathematics, which allowed a systematic analysis of the processes
   involved in and the consequences for biological evolution. Moreover,
   using formal theoretical models has proven useful for extracting the
   most important features from complex processes, by keeping track of
   many often parallel processes, and they explain complex macroscopic
   patterns (e.g. diversity and distribution of traits) with simpler
   individual-level processes, such as variability, competition and
   inheritance.

   Inspired by this progress, the now seminal works by Cavalli-Sforza &amp;
   Feldman [15], Lumsden &amp; Wilson [16] and Boyd &amp; Richerson [17] aimed
   collectively at a general theory of culture. The idea was to base this
   new theory on mathematical approaches from population dynamics and
   genetics to explain the distribution and change of traits in
   populations of individuals, be it genetic or cultural traits. To
   justify this approach, the authors assumed and outlined structural and
   conceptual analogies between biological and cultural evolution. At an
   abstract level, population-level processes in both domains are
   characterized by the continuous emergence, selective retention, and
   transmission of variation [18–21]. Hence, analogies have been made
   between the forces driving the evolution of genetic traits
   (transmission, mutation, drift and selection) and those driving the
   evolution of cultural traits (transmission, innovation, random
   fluctuations and selection). Additionally, both types are characterized
   by observable phenomena (e.g. an adapted species and cumulative
   culture) that are high-level properties (of a species and a population,
   respectively), which are the result of low-level interactions (at the
   level of individuals). Finally, both biological and cultural evolution
   are cumulative processes. That is, traits evolve successively through
   repeatedly modifying, combining, re-combining and re-purposing existing
   traits. These novel traits could not evolve in just one or a few
   generations due to their historical dependencies [22]. This process can
   lead to adaptation and increased trait complexity. However, the latter
   is not strictly necessary for the former as adaptations can sometimes
   come with a significant reduction in complexity [23]. In box 1, we
   summarize the most important similarities which are discussed more
   thoroughly elsewhere [15,17–19,23–26].

   In contrast to the aforementioned general similarities, there are
   obvious differences between cultural and biological evolution that
   require mathematical approaches to be adapted [27]. For example, if
   parents exhibit different variants of a cultural trait (e.g. hunting
   versus fishing), then there is no general principle that makes their
   children prefer one over the other. Children might even reject traits
   from both parents, which is impossible for genetic traits.
   Additionally, cultural traits are not strictly acquired from parents
   (vertical transmission). Instead, transmission can occur between any
   individuals, from one-to-many or many-to-one. And so, traits can also
   be acquired from peers (horizontal) or other adults (oblique); even
   inverse transmission from younger to older individuals is common.
   Moreover, biases towards copying successful, powerful, prestigious, or
   otherwise notable individuals can further modify the transmission
   dynamics [28]. The different transmission modes and biases, and their
   combinations, give rise to a large and complex space of potential
   patterns and dynamics in the distribution of cultural traits.

   In fact, this space is so rich that the overwhelming amount of cultural
   evolution research has primarily focused on cultural transmission. What
   the aforementioned seminal books started has become a rich and vibrant
   research field that has garnered much interest from researchers across
   disciplines, leading to a large number of recent books (e.g.
   [1,11,29–31]) and themed journal issues (e.g. [32–35]). Moreover,
   recent research articles show that the study of cultural transmission
   is not only relevant for understanding what shaped human origins, but
   also to make sense of what is happening in the present, from the spread
   of news on social media [36] to healthy behaviour in social networks
   [37], and many other features of the ‘information age’. This
   development has also sparked the question to what extent culture exists
   in other animals [2], given the growing evidence for widespread social
   learning in nature [38–43].

   Precisely because of this surge of interest, we believe it is an ideal
   moment to identify potential avenues for future cultural evolution
   research. We believe that there are a number of differences between
   biological and cultural evolution that have still not received
   sufficient attention. We identify specific differences by contrasting
   characteristics of biological and cultural evolution and point out some
   (table 1) that are of special interest. Our analysis mainly focuses on
   unique features of the acquisition, storage, recall and transmission,
   and the emergence and selection of new cultural traits and how they
   differ from those associated with genetically inherited traits. We then
   discuss the consequences of these differences and potential
   implications for our understanding of cultural evolution. Our main aim
   is to contribute to opening up new lines of investigation, novel
   insights, and testable hypotheses.

   table is organized in a sequence of logical steps, beginning with the
   storage, acquisition, transmission and selection of traits, and ending
   with the generation of new variants. To keep the table comprehensive
   but intuitive, we used general models of evolution, with a standard
   model of a sexually reproducing species in the biological evolution
   column, and a minimal case of human cultural evolution in which culture
   is predominately stored as mental representations in the cultural
   evolution column.

   This paper is an attempt to elucidate and discuss important
   similarities and differences between biological and cultural evolution.
   We are aware that there are many different ways to approach this task,
   and so this list will never be exhaustive. Additionally, we constrain
   our scope to modelling approaches that rely on individual interactions
   to explain the emergence of higher-level patterns, as compared to those
   that, for example, apply phylogenetic methods on observed patterns to
   infer past dynamics (e.g. [44,45]). However, we believe that this
   discourse provides interesting, even provocative, new material for
   thought and discussion, which, we hope, will inform future research,
   experimental testing and especially formal theoretical work.

2.  Differences between biological and cultural evolution

   In this section, we summarize several important differences between
   biological and cultural evolution, before we discuss implications for
   theories of cultural evolution in the following section. Table 1 is an
   attempt to identify core differences by contrasting various aspects of
   biological and cultural evolution. Some of the listed differences have
   been considered previously [11,15,17,27,34] while others have received
   less attention. We argue that recognizing these differences will affect
   the understanding of cultural evolution in general, and modelling
   approaches in particular, as it is well known that even small changes
   to the mechanisms of dynamical systems can fundamentally change their
   behaviour, results and interpretation.

   It is important to note that (human) cognitive abilities, many unique,
   are a factor in many of the items listed under cultural evolution in
   the table and thus have consequences for the dynamics and outcome of
   cultural evolution. For instance, opportunities for cultural
   recombination and thus generation of new culture is significantly
   enhanced by human thinking, planning and problem-solving abilities.
   These abilities will also play an important role in individual
   filtering as well as in learning processes.

   The table entries would look partly different, for example, if we
   considered bacteria (with access to horizontal gene transfer [46]), and
   cultural artefacts and externalized information storage (see §2a). One
   aspect that is not included in the table is processing. While it is
   undoubtedly integral to both biological and cultural evolution, some
   sort of processing is occurring in all items of the table.

(a) Storage

   The way in which information is stored differs fundamentally between
   cultural and biological evolution. In biological evolution, information
   (genetic traits) is encoded in and stored as the sequence of physical
   molecular structures, the genome. By contrast, in cultural evolution,
   cultural information within individuals (cultural traits) takes the
   form of mental representations, which are encoded as neuronal
   connections in the brain. This difference in the nature of trait
   storage means that an individual cannot change its genome, but can make
   changes to the composition of its cultural traits. For example, while
   genes can be frequently and accurately accessed and copied, there are
   very limited possibilities of passing information to the genome that
   can be inherited by offspring. By contrast, mental representations
   cannot be directly observed or copied [47], but due to the high
   flexibility of the nervous system, mental representations can be
   continuously altered before they are exhibited and transmitted to
   others. These differences have consequences for the evolutionary
   dynamics and concerns several of the other items in the table, which we
   will address in §3.

   Since artefacts (cultural products) reside in the external world, all
   the information for producing them often need not be contained within
   individuals and can be easily transmitted and accumulated over
   generations. Furthermore, in the light of our ability to externalize
   information storage, computation and filtering (and in part creation),
   an increasingly important question is how information technology
   changes cultural evolution as well as our mental abilities (e.g. [29]).

(b) Acquisition

   Based on the difference in the nature of trait storage in cultural and
   biological evolution, the acquisition of traits is also fundamentally
   different. Genetic traits are in place at the beginning of an
   individual’s life, whereas cultural traits are acquired throughout the
   entire life. An important consequence of continuous acquisition is that
   culture is acquired sequentially through a combination of episodes of
   social learning (learning from others), and individual practice (trial
   and error, insight, etc.). The importance of individual practice cannot
   be understated. It has been demonstrated in numerous studies in
   developmental psychology and educational science that many cultural
   traits require substantial individual efforts to be successfully
   learned (e.g. [48,49]). For example, hunting skills require extensive
   social learning to acquire the fundamental behaviours and techniques
   but they also rely on lifelong improvement through individual learning
   [50]. This difference between cultural and biological evolution has
   received rather limited attention, but it may be one of the most
   important ones influencing evolutionary dynamics [51,52]. As we will
   discuss below, the fact that humans are born without culture and
   acquire culture sequentially, making the individual an active force in
   the transmission, has several consequences for the dynamics of cultural
   evolution, including, for instance, the fact that previously acquired
   traits can facilitate or even preclude the subsequent acquisition of
   other traits, and that an individual may transmit different trait
   variants during different stages of its life. The fact that culture is
   acquired sequentially does not exclude the importance of inborn
   predispositions or abilities in the acquisition of culture.

(c) Transmission

(i) Mechanism

   In contrast to the transmission of physical copies of instructions in
   biological systems, in cultural systems transmission happens indirectly
   through learning processes based on observations of other individuals’
   behaviours, or their products (including communication, objects, or
   alterations to the environment), such that the observer can form its
   own mental representation of a cultural trait. This difference between
   cultural and biological evolution is widely recognized [15,17,24] and
   consistent with general findings in developmental psychology and
   educational science (e.g. [48,49]). Nevertheless, the concrete
   transmission process and its consequences for the evolutionary dynamics
   are not fully understood and are subject to an ongoing debate (see
   §3b). At its centre is the role of the relative fidelity of
   transmission in cultural dynamics. Two main schools of thought have
   emerged. The ‘California’ school sees accurate transmission as the main
   cause for cultural stability [15,17,53,54], whereas the ‘Paris’ school
   highlights the importance of constant reconstruction through biased
   transformation towards cultural attractors [55–57]. Recent attempts to
   unify these two schools rely on differentiating between cultural traits
   that can be faithfully copied, that is, actions, and those that cannot,
   for example beliefs and ideas [47].

   It is also important to note the importance of language in the
   transmission of cultural traits [21,58–60]. It allows for the
   transmission of complex data by replacing direct observations,
   delivering insightful synthetic information, and providing effective
   feedback [61]. There are likely many cultural traits that require
   language communication to be successfully transmitted, for example,
   cognitive abilities such as counting, reading and mental arithmetic.

(ii) Pathways

   Given that mental representations of cultural traits are transmitted
   through observation and recreation, there is no fixed transmission
   direction. Compared to biological evolution, where genes are
   transmitted from parents to offspring, transmission in cultural
   evolution can occur between any individuals. The diversity of possible
   transmission pathways, which in themselves are subject to cultural
   evolution, leads to interesting complex patterns [62].

(iii) Receiver dependence

   Another interesting and increasingly recognized difference of
   transmission in biological and cultural evolution is that genetic
   traits are supplied all at once, without the participation of the new
   individual. By contrast, in the transmission of cultural traits, not
   only the sender (teacher, model or demonstrator) but also the receiver
   (student or observer) can actively affect the transmission dynamics and
   thus evolutionary dynamics [16,17]. For instance, the observer may be
   selective about what and from whom to learn [16,17,63]. Such biases or
   social learning strategies [64,65] may be inborn [16,17] or stem from
   previously acquired cultural traits [22,66].

(d) Sorting processes

   Sorting processes are processes that lead to a non-random change in the
   frequency of traits. In biological evolution, the main sorting process
   is natural selection. How it operates is usually clear and well
   understood, and it brings a general understanding of biological
   adaptations. In cultural evolution, the situation is considerably more
   complex, which is in part due to the active role each individual takes
   in acquiring, exhibiting and transmitting cultural traits [17]. The
   most explored sorting mechanism that involves the individual in this
   way, operates in the receiver during social learning, in which content,
   model or conformity biases favour the acquisition of certain traits
   while rejecting others [67]. A trait may also be favoured or rejected
   subsequently when individuals get experiences of using the trait ([66],
   this issue). Sorting will also occur if individuals selectively display
   traits to potential learners, and when the generation of new trait
   variants is incentive-driven. Individuals may also exercise social
   control by, for instance, trying to influence what others do, or
   communicate by selectively punishing or rewarding such acts [68–70]. In
   addition, there is natural selection in cultural evolution, since
   cultural traits can influence survival and reproduction of their
   carriers and so affect trait frequencies [15,17]. For instance, a habit
   that increases survival may spread because it will make carriers of the
   trait more common among demonstrators. For the same reason, a habit
   that decreases survival will gradually disappear.

   In summary, sorting is possibly the most complex part of the
   evolutionary dynamics of cultural evolution, as it involves a number of
   different processes, and several of these occur in combination with
   other key processes such as transmission and generation of new culture.

(e) Generation of variation

   The continuous generation of variation is a central aspect of
   evolution. A generally recognized difference between biological and
   cultural evolution is that genetic variation is random and unrelated to
   any need or purpose. By contrast, in cultural evolution the generation
   of new variants can also be incentive-driven. This means that it is
   directed towards solving a concrete problem or reaching a certain goal.
   Important mechanisms include cognitive processing [71], deliberate
   experimentation [72–74], as well as trial-and-error and associative
   learning processes [71,75]. However, cultural variants may also occur
   because of mistakes, transmission errors, by-products of trying to
   solve other problems, or other circumstances that produce results that
   the individuals may learn from and subsequently transmit to other
   individuals [72]. Note that successful learning from unintended or
   unexpected outcomes is not free from incentive-driven aspects as it
   requires that the individual recognizes how such observations can be
   used.

3.  Implications and challenges for cultural evolution theory

   The differences that we discussed in the previous section can have
   dramatic effects on the evolutionary dynamics. In this part, we will
   discuss a selection of these that we think are particularly important
   to the further development of cultural evolution theory.

(a) Potential for fast evolution and complex culture

   Cultural evolution can proceed much faster than biological evolution,
   both in rate of change and in terms of trait complexity. This has been
   pointed out previously, and several reasons are generally given for why
   this is the case [1,11,15,17,67,76,77]. Firstly, acquisition and
   transmission of cultural traits occur along many pathways and
   throughout an individual’s entire lifetime. Secondly, novel or modified
   traits can be transmitted directly to other individuals (which is why
   cultural evolution is sometimes described as Lamarckian rather than
   Darwinian). Thirdly, the generation of novel variants can be
   incentive-driven. This may have a dramatic effect on the rate of
   evolution, since cultural traits will be much more likely to be
   productive once they ‘enter’ the real world. And, finally, language can
   be an important tool for efficient cultural transmission. It is
   necessary for transmitting abstract ideas, beliefs and values, and is a
   tool for the transmission of complex cultural traits, such as opaque
   processes, inaccessible observations, practices, algorithms and other
   mental skills.

   A full understanding of evolutionary rates and complex culture also
   requires a detailed understanding of cumulative cultural evolution.
   Cumulative culture is not only the accumulation of traits but also the
   innovation of new traits by combining or recombining existing traits
   [78–80]. This can result in a gradual increase in complexity, as
   combinations can be recombined continuously, and may offer a better
   theory of how cultural complexity and cultural systems emerge (see
   §3d). Also, it could explain, through the power of combinatorics, how
   cultural evolution can generate a never-ending stream of new variation.

   For a better understanding of the role of language and recombination in
   cumulative cultural evolution, future research needs to address several
   important questions, such as:
     * i.
       What are the combinatorial properties that allow a seemingly
       unbounded generation of diversity and complexity in human
       cumulative cultural evolution?
     * ii.
       What is the role of language, symbolism, and cognitive abilities in
       cumulative cultural evolution?
     * iii.
       Can all types of cultural change be understood in evolutionary
       terms (listed in table 1), or do we need additional theoretical
       frameworks?

(b) Developmental processes are directly involved in acquisition and
transmission

   Development here refers broadly to the processes that shape and modify
   the individual during its lifetime. In biological evolution,
   development is usually separated from the processes that transmit
   genetic traits and its evolution is studied in life-history theory,
   which emphasizes the role of trade-offs [81]. By contrast, in cultural
   evolution, development and transmission processes tend to be more
   intertwined, as they occur on the same time scale. On the one hand, an
   individual’s experience is shaped by sequential encounters with its
   surrounding cultural environment. On the other hand, the individual
   itself contributes to the makeup of that cultural environment.

   Relevant progress in our understanding of developmental processes in
   humans has been made in a variety of disciplines, such as developmental
   psychology, educational science and linguistics [48,49]. Several
   general findings from empirical research in these fields are relevant
   to cultural evolution. First and foremost, development is generally
   incremental and time-consuming, starting with learning simple features
   and elements that are later integrated into a functional practical or
   mental skill. This is obvious for advanced skills like mental
   arithmetic [82–84], and reading and writing, but also required for more
   basic skills (e.g. [82,85,86]).

   A second key finding is that traits are typically acquired through a
   combination of social interactions and individual efforts
   [48,49,87,88]. Thus, social and individual learning are operating
   together rather than being alternative strategies. Furthermore,
   research on development has also clearly established that there is an
   extensive behavioural and mental flexibility in humans. This allows
   humans to acquire a large range of skills, many of recent origin and
   not part of our prehistory, like reading and writing, agricultural
   practices, playing chess, and computer programming. Performance is
   generally strongly correlated to the amount of training, for both
   domain-specific and domain-general skills [89]. Thus, psychology and
   educational science suggest that when we see faithful copying over
   generations, this depends on substantial learning efforts among
   individuals. The situation is complicated by findings showing that
   learning and memory abilities themselves respond to training, and are
   thus partly cultural and subject to cultural evolution [48,89,90].

   Previous theoretical models of cultural evolution typically use
   simplified assumptions about individual development and rely on simple
   copying mechanisms and strategies for social learning [91–94], or treat
   social and individual learning as opposing alternatives [17,95], whose
   evolution is generally studied in the absence of a
   learning–reproduction trade-off (see [96] for how classical results are
   critically changed once the learning–reproduction trade-off is taken
   into account).

   It is thus becoming increasingly clear that future models should
   incorporate developmental processes, especially for traits that cannot
   be acquired in a single learning episode (because they are combinations
   of simpler traits or because they require individual improvement).
   These models should further be embedded into a proper life-history
   context so as to make all traits pertaining to learning co-evolutionary
   [97].

   Challenges and questions for future research:
     * i.
       How can developmental psychology and related fields inform cultural
       evolution research? For example, in the debate between the
       ‘California’ and the ‘Paris’ school on why cultural learning can be
       faithful to its source and maintained over generations, while
       single transmission events are error-prone [53,54,98,99],
       developmental psychology might explain faithful transmission in
       terms of sequential learning including efficient corrective
       feedback loops.
     * ii.
       What is the scope of cultural evolution in terms of mental
       abilities? To what extent are mental abilities and psychological
       mechanisms learnt from or influenced by the cultural environment
       [100,101], and thus subject to cultural evolution themselves [30]?
       Future models that combine developmental processes and cultural
       evolution may help to distinguish the roles of inborn factors,
       acquired traits and individual experience.
     * iii.
       How does learning depend on an individual’s lifetime and how has it
       co-evolved with life history?

(c) Different evolutionary outcomes and cultural fitness

   In biological evolution, the fate of a trait can be understood by
   considering the average reproductive success of all carriers of that
   trait [102,103]. It is common to use optimization and game theoretic
   approaches to study evolutionary endpoints (i.e. adaptations). By
   contrast, in cultural evolution there is no generally accepted
   formulation of cultural fitness [104] as the relationship between the
   individual and its traits is more complicated. Here, transmission is
   not tied to biological reproduction, can occur between arbitrary
   individuals, and the individual is not fixed with respect to the
   cultural traits it possesses and exhibits to others during its life.
   These differences have implications both for the outcome of evolution
   and for how cultural evolution should be theoretically explored
   [11,15,17,52]. In principle, anything that influences transmission,
   retention and use of cultural traits needs to be considered.

   For instance, traits that are contagious enough can spread and be
   maintained in a population even if they reduce the survival and/or
   biological reproduction of individuals [105–107]. Suppose lifestyle A
   produces more children than lifestyle B and that parental lifestyles
   are often transmitted to the children. However, children are also
   exposed to the alternative lifestyle B, which is more attractive (e.g.
   because it is easier to learn). This may be driven by a genetic or
   cultural bias for this lifestyle, and could result in B increasing in
   frequency compared to A. Figure 1 provides a numerical example. A
   complete analysis of cultural evolution scenarios of this kind requires
   exploration of both the evolution of lifestyles and the evolution of
   preferences for lifestyles [108].

   Figure 1.

   A numerical example showing how a lifestyle associated with lower
   fertility could spread in cultural evolution (see §3c).

   In any human society, we find a range of both material and non-material
   culture serving the well-being, survival and reproduction of
   individuals or the group. However, we can also observe phenomena that
   are more difficult to interpret as adaptive in this way. We spend
   significant amounts of time learning to play musical instruments and
   chess. Often, our actions and beliefs do not even promote the goals
   they are aimed at, like when anti-vaxxers refuse medically motivated
   vaccinations in order to promote health [109].

   It is quite possible that concepts like adaptation and fitness in
   cultural evolution will not have equivalent and as straightforward
   meanings as they do in biological evolution. The complication is that
   individuals are subject to change during their lives, which can be
   illustrated by comparing a trait that transmits rather slowly to
   others, but tends to stay with an individual once it is acquired, with
   a trait that transmits quickly to other individuals, but is easily
   abandoned or replaced. The latter trait may be easy to learn, or has
   some immediate attraction, but is less productive. Which trait spreads
   can depend on trait content and thus may not be predictable by
   considering an elementary set of rules of transmission [110].

   It has been suggested that the fitness of cultural traits can be based
   on just the traits or free-floating memes [104]. While this can be a
   useful approach for certain questions, a general theory of cultural
   evolution cannot ignore the individual because of its active roll in
   acquiring, processing and exhibiting cultural traits [104]. This is one
   of the reasons that make it so tricky to find a useful concept of units
   of evolution in cultural evolution (a unit might be the single cultural
   trait or a set of traits, but also the carrier of a trait, etc.).

   Challenges and questions for future research:
     * i.
       Is it possible to provide a general theoretical account for the
       observed diversity of outcomes of human cultural evolution?
     * ii.
       How can we define and recognize cultural adaptations, at what level
       are they manifested, and how can we use them to identify useful
       units of cultural evolution?
     * iii.
       What could be a useful concept of fitness in cultural evolution,
       and, if it exists, how can it be used to study cultural evolution?

(d) Trait interactions, cultural systems and evolving evolutionary dynamics

   The facts that individuals acquire traits sequentially and that traits
   can interact may have important organizing effects. The resulting
   developmental path dependence (see §3b) can limit which traits an
   individual acquires, and so promote the evolution of cultural systems
   [22,55,66,111,112]. For instance, an individual might acquire a belief
   A about the world, which subsequently facilitates the acquisition of
   other beliefs that are consistent with A but leads to the rejection of
   beliefs that are not [113]. If, instead, the individual would first
   acquire an alternative belief B, then this could trigger the eventual
   acquisition of an entirely different belief system. Similar reasoning
   can apply to other categories of traits. In fact, there are many ways
   in which traits can interact and influence evolution. Traits may or may
   not operate well together (within or between individuals), they might
   express preferences towards other traits, and define goals the
   individual strives for that are better served by certain traits than
   others. Traits can also be clustered in space (e.g. co-occurrence of
   traits relevant for fishing near bodies of water) or time (e.g.
   seasonal occurrence of sets of traits), and may even influence social
   network structure, and thus lead to exposure to different sets of
   traits [62]. The fact that culture exists in the form of systems,
   contexts or structures of interrelated parts, manifested both in
   individuals and in groups of individuals, is generally recognized in
   the humanities and social sciences [22]. It is possible that many
   cultural phenomena can only be understood from an explicit systems
   perspective.

   Trait interactions could also have even more pronounced effects, and
   bring about changes to the evolutionary process itself, that is,
   important aspects of cultural evolution dynamics may themselves be
   results of cultural evolution rather than determined by genetic factors
   or external circumstances [22,114,115]. Examples of such changes in
   biological evolution are migration, mutation and sexual reproduction,
   which are called modifier traits. These traits have important
   consequences for the dynamics of biological evolution, but they are
   also products of that same evolution, thus resulting in
   counterintuitive feedbacks [116]. All items in table 1 are potentially
   subject to cultural evolution, and it has been suggested that cultural
   evolution itself can influence social learning abilities [1], efforts
   by senders’ and receivers’ willingness to change [114,117], and
   transmission pathways [62]. Culturally established goals could have a
   dramatic effect on the outcome of cultural evolution. Acerbi et al.
   [114] introduced the term regulatory traits for cultural traits that
   influence the dynamics of the evolutionary process and suggested that
   their evolution depends on their ability to directly or indirectly
   influence their own evolution.

   The organizing effects of interactions and feedbacks can also be seen
   in the broader perspective of evolutionary transitions. These are
   fundamental modifications to the evolutionary process, caused by
   evolution itself. Maynard Smith &amp; Szathmáry [21] recognized several
   properties common to such transitions, which we can also find in human
   cultural evolution. The first property is that new ways of transmitting
   information are formed. Humans have invented a series of information
   technologies, like reading and writing, radio and television, databases
   and pocket calculators, which can store, as well as communicate or
   broadcast, cultural traits, and also help us think and make decisions.
   A second property of transitions is that smaller entities aggregate to
   form larger ones and that the smaller entities tend to differentiate.
   Humans form a diversity of societies that are conceivably different
   from those that existed at the dawn of human culture, with for instance
   complex political and social organizations, division of labour,
   individual specializations and long production chains, and organized
   transmission of cultural traits via institutions like schools (e.g.
   [5,118–120]).

   Challenges and questions for future research:
     * i.
       What new understanding can be gained from a systems approach that
       cannot be gained from considerations of simpler representations of
       culture?
     * ii.
       How can the evolution of cultural systems be explored
       theoretically? This requires formal descriptions of cultural
       systems, an understanding of trait relationships, and evolutionary
       modelling approaches that take into account that cultural systems
       exist and operate within and between individuals ([66], this
       issue).
     * iii.
       How do externalized information storage and processing affect
       cultural evolution?

4.  Concluding remarks

   Studying cultural evolution in an evolutionary framework has come a
   long way. The development of this research programme has proven
   invaluable to our understanding of many cultural phenomena. The many
   differences between cultural and biological evolution, while not
   invalidating an evolutionary approach, show that there is a rich
   research field with many potentially interesting avenues for future
   studies. The way mental representations are stored, recalled,
   transmitted and modified, and the active role the individual plays in
   all of these stages, leads to a level of complexity that may even
   require entirely new analytical and modelling approaches to be fully
   understood.

   We hope that the collection of ideas we have presented here have
   highlighted some of the complexity of cultural evolution, which occurs
   at different organizational levels, along different timelines, between
   the material and the immaterial, and the biotic and abiotic world.
   Clearly, a full understanding of culture requires interdisciplinary
   efforts. Fortunately, cultural evolution research has always been at
   home in a variety of disciplines. And on closer inspection, much work
   has been evolutionary at its core, even if the term was not explicitly
   used.

   The discussions at the Leiden meeting leading to this paper (see
   Acknowledgements) have emphasized the value of overcoming semantic
   barriers that exist across disciplines. Despite different historical
   motivations, perspectives and approaches to cultural evolution
   research, there are shared ambitions and overlapping questions. We
   would like to close this essay with three suggestions to strengthen the
   interdisciplinary approach and to counteract isolation between
   different schools of thought:

   Focusing on questions relevant to the social sciences and humanities.
   To strengthen interdisciplinary work, we believe it would be useful to
   address more of the cultural and social phenomena that are intensively
   studied within the humanities and the social sciences. Potential
   examples are tribalism, race and gender issues, knowledge resistance,
   segregation, social immobility, systems of belief, cooperation, trust
   and polarization. There has been a tendency to focus on general
   questions in cultural evolution modelling, such as the emergence,
   change, transmission and accumulation of cultural traits. By
   considering more specific phenomena, it should also be possible to
   generate new concrete and testable hypotheses. Perhaps one of the best
   examples of a productive interaction between cultural evolutionary
   theorising and empirical research, blending general and specific
   theories with in-depth knowledge about the phenomena, can be found in
   recent developments in language evolution [121].

   Acknowledging existing work in other fields. We also think that it is
   important to pay more attention to existing thinking and theory within
   the humanities and the social sciences, and also to make use of the
   wealth of existing empirical data on human culture. There are two
   aspects to this. One is that evolutionary thinking is not a novel
   concept in the humanities and social sciences, as we discussed above.
   The other is that many theories, including verbal, statistical and
   mathematical models, are genuinely evolutionary in our sense, without
   using the term evolution. Thus there are clear overlapping goals with
   cultural evolutionary research. This applies to both older verbal
   hypotheses and recent theoretical work. A few examples of the latter
   include: studies on social learning dynamics in evolutionary game
   theory in economics [122,123]; the dynamics of knowledge production and
   acquisition at the aggregate (population) level studied in
   macroeconomics [124–127]; and models of beliefs of agents studied in
   sociology [128,129]. Microeconomics has also adopted the cultural
   evolution framework, as introduced by Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, and
   applies it to all sorts of questions [130,131]. An important next step
   in acknowledging existing research must be synthetic work. It has
   become increasingly clear that it is almost impossible to embrace all
   theories of cultural change that exist. There is a real need for
   synthetic work, to avoid reinvention, and to recognize both general and
   specific theories about cultural change that deserve to be further
   explored.

   Connecting disciplines. Finally, we suggest making use of knowledge
   from and cooperation with a few fields that are rarely mentioned in
   formal theoretical studies of cultural evolution. Two such fields that
   we have mentioned throughout this paper are developmental psychology
   and educational science. Together these fields have gathered important
   insights into individual development and social learning. Many of the
   scenarios described, and the interaction with individual learning,
   differ from assumptions and strategic thinking about social learning
   common in cultural evolution research. They also offer insight into
   nature–nurture issues, the scope of cultural evolution, and how mental
   abilities can be transmitted. Another field of potential interest is
   artificial intelligence and related fields in cognitive science, which
   hold many ideas about learning processes and cognitive abilities.

Abstract

   Drawing insights from multiple disciplines is essential for finding
   integrative solutions that are required to tackle complex environmental
   problems. Human activities are causing unprecedented influence on
   global ecosystems, culminating in the loss of species and fundamental
   changes in the selective environments of organisms across the tree of
   life. Our collective understanding about biological evolution can help
   identify and mitigate many of the environmental problems in the
   Anthropocene. To this end, we propose a stronger integration of
   environmental sciences with evolutionary biology.

1. Introduction

   All ecosystems, be they natural or engineered, contain biological
   organisms that are bound by the principles of biological evolution. As
   such, biological evolution is often a central feature of many problems
   that are currently being tackled by environmental scientists. Yet
   fundamental principles from the discipline of evolutionary biology are
   rarely used in the analysis and mitigation of environmental problems,
   even when evolutionary processes are closely linked to their
   manifestation (Carroll et al., 2014; Jørgensen et al., 2019).
   Environmental scientists are particularly adept at reaching across
   disciplines to ensure that they have the knowledge and tools necessary
   to tackle complex environmental problems. Here we propose that a wider
   application of principles of evolutionary biology would help us achieve
   more sustainable solutions to environmental problems.

   In brief, evolution is a process of heritable change in the phenotype
   of a population of organisms (Box 1). While evolution can result from
   random genetic drift (representing “neutral” evolution), here we focus
   on adaptive evolution, defined as a change in population mean fitness
   in response to natural selection (Box 1). Genetic and trait variation,
   and how such variation changes over time and space, are fundamental
   properties of living systems. There is mounting evidence that evolution
   is sufficiently fast in natural populations to be highly relevant for
   understanding how populations will respond to human-mediated
   environmental change (Hendry and Kinnison, 1999; Hendry, 2017).

Box 1

The four forces of evolution.

     * Mutation

   Mutations are random, heritable changes in the sequence or structure of
   a gene. They include substitutions of individual bases in the DNA
   sequence, insertions and deletions of DNA fragments, and structural
   rearrangements of chromosomes. New variants of the same gene generated
   by mutation are referred to as alleles. Mutations can be neutral,
   meaning they do not affect the phenotype of their carrier, advantageous
   in specific environments, meaning they affect the phenotype such that
   it increases survival and/or reproduction, i.e. fitness, or deleterious
   in specific environments. For example, a mutation that confers
   resistance to a pesticide may be beneficial in an environment where the
   pesticide is present but detrimental in an environment where the
   pesticide is absent. Mutations are the ultimate source of genetic
   variation and provide the original resource for adaptive evolution and
   biological innovation.
     * Natural selection

   Natural selection is the process of unequal survival and reproduction
   among individuals due to differences in phenotype. Some individuals of
   the population are more likely to survive and reproduce because they
   have trait combinations that make them better at coping with the
   current environment than other individuals. Assuming that the
   phenotypic traits under selection are heritable, i.e. trait values are
   transmitted across generations, the favorable traits, which represent
   ‘good genes’, will be passed to the offspring. In this way, the
   frequency of the ‘good’ gene variants will increase in the population,
   leading to evolutionary adaptation.
     * Gene flow

   Gene flow is the exchange of genetic material between populations. It
   occurs when individuals or their gametes migrate into a new population
   and reproduce. Gene flow can bring new alleles (i.e. genetic variants)
   into the receiving population and thereby influence the potential for
   this population to evolve. Gene flow can be maladaptive, and reduce the
   fitness of the local population, or adaptive. If migration is
   sufficiently high and migrant genes are not selected against, gene flow
   will homogenize allele frequencies and reduce genetic differences in
   the genetic composition of populations.
     * Genetic drift

   Genetic drift is the stochastic change in allele frequencies over
   generations. It occurs because allele frequencies in populations can
   deviate by chance from those of the parental generation, due to the
   random sampling of gametes. It affects particularly small populations.
   It can lead to the loss of genetic variation and the accumulation of
   deleterious mutations and, as a result, constrain a population's
   adaptation to changing environmental conditions.

   Alt-text: Box 1

   Applying evolutionary principles to understand environmental problems
   is not a novel idea (Gunderson and Holling, 2002, Santamaria and
   Mendez, 2012), but widespread application is still limited (Jørgensen
   et al., 2019). In the context of the biodiversity crisis ecologists are
   increasingly using evolutionary theory to help mitigate the loss of
   genetic and species diversity due to climate change and environmental
   pollution (Bell and Gonzalez, 2009; Kristensen et al., 2018).
   evolutionary theory is also critical to understanding the emergence of
   antibiotic resistance in microbes (Palmer and Kishony, 2013) and
   chemical resistance in pests (Fisher et al., 2018). Plainly,
   evolutionary theory can be highly relevant to pertinent environmental
   problems, but it is not broadly applied. There is a frequent use of
   methods and technologies originating from evolutionary biology. In
   particular, molecular genetic methods are often used to characterise
   microbial community composition (Das and Dash, 2019), and the patterns
   of gene expression of individual organisms and communities (Oziolor et
   al., 2017). While such methods are undeniably useful to gain functional
   insights, they are rarely used in environmental science to study
   evolutionary processes. The potential for evolutionary applications in
   environmental sciences is far reaching, and in the next sections we
   focus on core concepts of evolution and exemplify how they can be
   applied to a range of environmental problems in aquatic ecosystems.

1.1. The structure of evolutionary processes

   The structure and rate of change of heritable trait variation in living
   systems are particularly relevant for understanding environmental
   problems. Living systems are hierarchically structured, where the
   traits of individuals arise from the interpretation of the environment
   by genes (so called genotype-phenotype maps; (Houle et al., 2010)).
   Individuals interact within populations, where average trait values
   change through evolutionary and environmental processes (Burns, 1992;
   Frank, 2011; Pedersen and Tuomi, 1995), and populations interact and
   evolve within multi-species communities (Weber et al., 2017). As a
   result of this hierarchical structure, human activities affecting one
   level of biological organization can have unanticipated outcomes at
   another level (Gunderson and Holling, 2002; Melián et al., 2018). For
   example, human activities that affect gene flow among populations can
   lead to the introduction of either beneficial alleles that help
   populations adapt to changing environments, or deleterious alleles that
   contribute to maladaptation of natural populations and thereby can
   potentially hinder conservation efforts (Leitwein et al., 2019).
   Despite the long held view that evolution is a slow process, it is now
   well established that the pace of heritable trait change can be
   sufficiently fast to affect population dynamics, species interactions,
   and ecosystem processes - i.e. evolution can act at ecological time
   scales (Hairston et al., 2005; Stockwell et al., 2003). The dynamics of
   species interactions in natural communities are hence not simply a
   product of past evolution. Rather, evolutionary processes can shape
   trait distributions of populations (i.e. mean and variance) at a pace
   that is highly relevant for many environmental problems.

   evolutionary processes can either ameliorate or exacerbate
   environmental problems. evolutionary adaptation, for example, can drive
   the recovery of populations, or even multi-species communities, from
   decline, in a process known as “evolutionary rescue” (Bell and
   Gonzalez, 2009; Low-Décarie et al., 2015). In natural populations,
   evolution has rescued killifish from chemical pollution (Whitehead et
   al., 2017) and amphibians from acidification (Hangartner et al., 2012).
   In these cases, genetic adaptation has allowed for the persistence of
   populations in environments that would otherwise be unsuitable.
   evolutionary novelty can also emerge in populations exposed to
   synthetic environments created by humans, and, in doing so, perform
   essential evosystem services (Rudman et al., 2017). For example, the
   artificial sweetener acesulfame (ACE) is a persistent compound in
   aquatic environments because it is resistant to microbial-mediated
   biodegradation both in natural and wastewater treatment environments
   (Kahl et al., 2018). Recent work suggests that the catabolism of this
   compound has evolved repeatedly in multiple wastewater treatment plants
   in Germany (Kahl et al., 2018), possibly associated with a microbial
   consortium of proteobacterial species (Fig. 1 ). Identifying the
   evolutionary processes governing such bioremediation dynamics could
   help address the persistence of chemicals in our natural environments
   for which engineering solutions are lacking. On the other hand,
   evolutionary processes can also create novel environmental problems, or
   worsen existing ones. For example, the emergence and amplification of
   antibiotic resistance genes is a global problem, caused by the
   widespread overuse of antibiotics (Palmer and Kishony, 2013). In
   wastewater treatment plants, the concentration of antibiotic resistance
   genes may be amplified by evolution prior to water discharge into
   natural aquatic environments (Ju et al., 2019) (Fig. 1). Understanding
   and monitoring the evolutionary process in wastewater treatment plants
   could improve our ability to limit the release of antibiotic resistance
   genes into natural environments (Czekalski et al., 2015).

   Two scenarios illustrating how microbial evolution within a wastewater
   treatment plant (WWTP) can either cause a beneficial reduction in a
   pollutant concentration (ACE: the artificial sweetener Acesulfame) due
   to the evolution of catabolism of novel/synthetic compounds, or an
   unwanted increase in resistance genes in a microbial population due to
   positive selection in the treatment plant (Figure design by Peter
   Penicka, EAWAG).

2. Case studies

   In this section, we illustrate how a broader application of
   evolutionary theory can enable environmental scientists to craft better
   solutions for environmental problems. To this end, we use four examples
   from aquatic systems: (i) emergence and epidemiology of disease, (ii)
   renewable production of biofuels, (iii) chemical pollution, and (iv)
   outbreaks of algal blooms.

2.1. Disease dynamics in natural populations: when evolution kills or cures

   Diseases are among the most severe environmental problems. They are a
   threat to biodiversity (Fisher et al., 2018; Lips et al., 2006), to
   food production (Strange and Scott, 2005) and to human health (Jones et
   al., 2008). Disease outbreaks are often caused by pathogens that have
   undergone a recent host shift or expansion of their geographic range
   (Engering et al., 2013; Longdon et al., 2014). Most disease-causing
   organisms have large populations and short generation times, which
   generally facilitates rapid evolution. Consequently, disease emergence
   typically involves rapid co-evolutionary dynamics that stem from
   natural selection on both pathogen infectivity and host defense
   (Penczykowski et al., 2016). Rapid evolutionary dynamics are expected
   to take place at the onset of disease emergence, governed by the
   pathogens' and the hosts' evolutionary history.

   Disease emergence is often a consequence of human activities. Transport
   between continents can bring pathogens into naïve host populations that
   are, at least initially, defenseless; they can lack sufficient genetic
   variation for resistance because they do not have coevolutionary
   history with these pathogens. The crayfish plague provides a good
   example. Aphanomyces astaci, a pathogen of freshwater crayfish native
   to North America came to Europe with introduced American crayfish
   (Svoboda et al., 2017). American crayfish species had evolved a high
   tolerance of the pathogen, due to their long evolutionary history, but
   the pathogen proved devastating to stocks of European freshwater
   crayfish species (Holdich et al., 2009). Likewise, human activities
   that modify ecosystems for food production can promote the emergence of
   locally highly virulent pathogens (Stukenbrock and McDonald, 2008). For
   example, large monocultures of genetically homogenous plants can
   facilitate the evolution of host specialization (McDonald and
   Stukenbrock, 2016), leading to evolutionary dynamics that are not
   commonly observed in natural ecosystems.

   evolutionary theory can be instrumental in helping to understand the
   origin and spread of diseases through populations. Increasingly,
   researchers can track disease dynamics over time by comparing genetic
   variation among isolates, and such data can help inform policy decision
   and management of viral diseases, such as COVID-19 (Andersen et al.,
   2020, Brüssow, 2020) and Ebola (Mbala-Kingebeni et al., 2019). Drug
   treatment is often the default approach used to control emergent
   bacterial and fungal diseases, but in some cases a single new drug can
   cause strong natural selection, and, combined with the high
   evolutionary potential of pathogens, this means that the expected time
   until drug resistance evolves can be short (Fisher et al., 2018;
   Kennedy and Read, 2018). For such scenarios, we need to develop
   evolution-aware strategies to avoid and control emergent diseases. For
   example, in the case of chemical treatments, combination therapy or the
   sequential application of different drugs can delay resistance
   evolution (Palmer and Kishony, 2013; Roemhild et al., 2018), and the
   development of ‘evolution-proof’ drugs is a particularly attractive
   idea (Bell and MacLean, 2018). Alternative strategies include fighting
   the disease with agents that are able to evolve themselves, such as
   microbial symbionts that provide protection against the disease
   (Kueneman et al., 2016).

2.2. Renewable biofuels: when evolution fills our tanks

   The dwindling supply and the negative environmental impact of fossil
   fuels have spurred substantial research and investment into using
   biofuels as a renewable and sustainable source of energy (Sheehan et
   al., 1998). Among the many potential sources of biomass for biofuels,
   phytoplankton or “algal” biofuels are among the most efficient in terms
   of land-use and energy production per unit biomass (Y. Chisti, 2008;
   Yusuf Chisti, 2007). Until now, algal biomass production for biofuel
   has heavily focused on the production of single species with desirable
   properties, namely high lipid content, fast growth rates, and
   resistance to disease and grazers. However, farming monocultures is
   notoriously difficult because individual species or strains, be they
   algae or crops, can never possess all of the desirable traits for
   long-term stable crop production at high yields (Smith et al., 2010).
   The ideal species for maximum production would be unconstrained by the
   trade-offs inherent to all living systems. Yet such omnipotent
   organisms, known in evolutionary biology as Darwinian demons (Krakauer,
   2011; Law, 1979), do not exist and cannot be engineered. Nevertheless,
   sustainable yield of biofuels could be optimized by understanding the
   biochemical and biophysical basis of the fundamental trade-offs between
   growth rate, lipid production and traits that make better competitors,
   confer resistance to parasites, and are resistant to grazers (Shurin et
   al., 2013, Shurin et al., 2016; T. Yoshida et al., 2004). Understanding
   the evolution of ecologically relevant traits, under different biotic
   and abiotic contexts, may improve the stability and efficiency of
   biofuel production.

   The application of evolutionary theory to algal biofuel production is
   in its infancy, but holds immense potential. Algal populations are
   large and have short generation times. Usually the populations maintain
   high phenotypic and genetic diversity (Brandenburg et al., 2018; Chen
   and Rynearson, 2016; Lebret et al., 2012; Masseret et al., 2009;
   Rynearson and Armbrust, 2000). evolution in such populations can be
   fast if selection is strong (Thibodeau et al., 2015; Takehito Yoshida
   et al., 2003). Harnessing the adaptive evolutionary potential of algal
   populations could help us explore the range of feasible trait space to
   obtain desirable trait combinations. For example, researchers are
   currently trying to simultaneously improve the yield of
   triacylglycerols in culture (used to produce fatty acid methyl esters
   needed used in biodiesel production), while concurrently maximizing
   population growth rates. Such trait combinations are normally mutually
   exclusive. Approaches include genetic engineering (Zeng et al., 2011),
   directed evolution via successive rounds of mutagenesis and selection
   (Johnson et al., 2016; Lewin et al., 2016), and selection on the
   existing levels of genetic variation in a population (Mooij et al.,
   2013; Shurin et al., 2016).

   While evolution might help us improve biofuel production (Kazamia et
   al., 2014), it might also culminate in undesirable outcomes. For
   example, engineering solutions based on evolutionary trade-offs might
   be eroded over time due to mutation, horizontal gene transfer, and
   recombination. Custom designed biofuel production systems should also
   consider the evolutionary consequences of rapid harvesting. For
   example, rare beneficial mutations arising during population expansion,
   might be periodically lost before they sweep to dominance in the
   populations (Bull and Collins, 2012; Shurin et al., 2016). In short,
   evolution offers both promises and pitfalls for biofuel production.

2.3. Chemical pollutants: when evolution is, and is not, the solution to
pollution

   Chemical pollution is a global problem with a local character (Grimm et
   al., 2008; Halpern et al., 2008; Vörösmarty et al., 2010). Chemical
   pollution often stems from chemical pest control applied in
   agricultural production, as well as from the unwanted waste produced by
   human population growth and industrial activities. Wastewater treatment
   plants can only remove and target compounds that pass through the
   sewage system; many other compounds still enter the natural environment
   in a diffuse manner, especially from agriculture. These chemical
   compounds can have toxic effects on individual organisms and these
   effects can be enhanced when they occur in mixtures (Abdelghani et al.,
   1997; Connon et al., 2012). For instance, pest control requires highly
   biologically active substances to target unwanted algae, fungi and
   arthropods. When pesticides then leak into ecosystems that are not the
   target of the application, this can change food web structure and
   influence ecosystem function (Stamm et al., 2016).

   Because pollution and the ecological context in which pollution occurs
   is often highly local, we can expect pollution to have many different
   evolutionary consequences in natural ecosystems. However, the
   biological effects of pollutants are typically studied using a limited
   number of model species and strains, usually in oversimplified
   ecological contexts that might underestimate their effects in nature
   (Relyea and Hoverman, 2006). Furthermore, many of the approaches used
   in environmental science and ecotoxicology to assess the environmental
   effects of pollutants only test a few selected genetic lineages of
   organisms (e.g., single strains of Daphnia), and often ignore both
   within-population variation in sensitivity to pollutants and the
   effects of mixtures of pollutants on organisms. For example,
   morphologically similar but genetically distinct lineages of amphipods,
   within the Gammarus fossarum cryptic species complex, vary in their
   sensitivity to the fungicide tebuconazole and the insecticide
   thiacloprid (Feckler et al., 2012). Such lineage diversity within
   species is rarely accounted for in typical assessments of pollutants on
   organisms (Relyea and Hoverman, 2006). Synthetic chemicals present a
   particular challenge because the exposed organisms may lack the
   exposure history necessary for the emergence of an evolutionary
   adaptation. Synthetic chemicals can also act as mutagens that disrupt
   the homeostasis of organisms (Bickham et al., 2000).

   Chemical toxicity can rapidly drive populations to such small sizes
   that their persistence over time becomes threatened (Williams and
   Oleksiak, 2008). Interestingly many classic studies about rapid
   evolution involve chemical pollution, such as the evolution of
   resistance to pesticides, resistance to antibiotics or mining-related
   metal pollution (Hoffmann and Parsons, 1997; Palumbi, 2009) and, more
   recently, pollutant induced elevated mutation rates and rapid
   adaptation (Brady et al., 2017; Coutellec and Barata, 2013; Kimberly
   and Salice, 2012; Loria et al., 2019; Palumbi, 2009). evolutionary
   adaptation to chemical pollution can also rescue populations from
   extinction caused by demographic decline. For example, experimental
   Daphnia populations that were initially highly sensitive to metal
   contamination recovered rapidly via genetic adaptation (Hochmuth et
   al., 2015). In another example, natural killifish populations
   inhabiting urban estuaries adapted to lethal levels of pollutants with
   genetic adaptations (Oziolor et al., 2017; Reid et al., 2016).
   Unsurprisingly, adaptation of a population can also be an unwanted
   outcome of management, such as when the evolution of resistance reduces
   the sensitivity of a species used in ecological risk assessment (Morgan
   et al., 2007). evolution's ability to alter the direction of responses
   to environmental change, such as that brought by chemical pollution, is
   one of the main arguments for including evolutionary concepts in
   environmental research. Finally, potential for evolutionarily based
   solutions to pollution comes from implementing bioremediation, such as
   designing microbial communities that have evolved the ability of
   biodegradation of chemicals (Liu and Suflita, 1993).

2.4. Algal blooms: when evolution muddies the waters

   Harmful algal blooms are often associated with eutrophication,
   pollution and climate change (Huisman et al., 2018; Monchamp et al.,
   2018). Harmful algal blooms, which can persist for weeks or months, may
   foul drinking water, turn lakes anoxic and kill fish, and render lakes
   unacceptable for recreational use (Lewitus et al., 2012; Paerl et al.,
   2011). Ecological theory suggests that blooms develop when nutrient
   input releases phytoplankton from control by grazers (Abrams and
   Walters, 1996; Gragnani et al., 1999; Pančić and Kiørboe, 2018).
   Additionally, evolutionary processes are also relevant to the
   emergence, volume and toxicity of blooms. Indeed, we postulate that
   trying to manage harmful blooms without Darwin, is like trying to fly
   to the moon without Newton (modifying Andrew Read's concluding remark
   on his TEDMED talk on importance of evolutionary medicine:
   https://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=7286).

   The trade-off between resource uptake and grazing resistance is at the
   root of the ecological and evolutionary causes of bloom biomass
   (Cloern, 2018). Selective grazing by zooplankton will deplete edible
   algae and, subsequently, increase the abundance of well-defended algae
   (Hairston et al., 2005; Takehito Yoshida et al., 2003). Harmful algal
   blooms are characterised by an array of defense traits that are favored
   by natural selection. Some algae produce compounds that are toxic to
   grazers, such as the neurotoxins, saxitoxins and domoic acid produced
   by dinoflagellates, cyanobacteria, and diatoms, respectively (Pančić
   and Kiørboe, 2018; Xu and Kiørboe, 2018). Remarkably, toxin production
   varies widely both within and among populations. For example, some
   lineages entirely lack the genes for toxin production (Brandenburg et
   al., 2018; Briand et al., 2009). The evolutionary dynamics of different
   toxic/non-toxic genotypes during algal blooms is likely driven by
   physiological trade-offs between costs of toxin production and resource
   uptake for growth (Brandenburg et al., 2018; Cadier et al., 2019;
   Chakraborty et al., 2019; Kiørboe and Andersen, 2019). Such
   defense-growth trade-offs are likely important for the emergence of
   harmful algal blooms (Burford et al., 2019; Jankowiak et al., 2019; Kim
   et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012), but the selective factors that favor
   toxic variants in bloom forming algae are not fully understood.
   Identifying the evolutionary processes involved in algal blooms would
   likely help us predict which algal blooms might turn toxic. In a first
   step, reliable prediction would enable the avoidance of risks
   associated with toxic algal blooms (e.g. by timely establishment of
   exclusion zones), and in a second step, it could inform mitigation
   measures to reduce the occurrence of algal blooms (e.g. by influencing
   relevant selective forces such as nutrient input).

3. Evolving the environmental sciences

   evolutionary processes are often an inescapable and critical component
   of both understanding and solving environmental problems. The evolution
   of resistance genes will continually challenge our efforts to halt
   diseases through the development of new drugs, highlighting the need to
   complement efforts in drug discovery with the development of
   evolution-aware application strategies. A better appreciation of
   evolution's limits and, in particular, the impossibility of Darwinian
   demons, is critical to meeting our energy demands by matching algal
   genotypes with optimal environmental conditions for biofuel production.
   In a similar vein, choosing strains that have evolved tolerance to
   pollutants might help sustain populations in deteriorating
   environments, while strains naive to pollution might be a more
   conservative option when assessing ecological risk to chemical
   pollutants. Engineering solutions in waste-water treatment plants might
   be improved if we could harness evolution's power to help biodegrade
   persistent compounds (Brenner et al., 2008). Other environmental
   problems with limited engineering-oriented solutions could be tackled
   with evolutionary perspectives. For example, biocides may be applied to
   combat algal blooms, but it is notoriously difficult to predict the
   timing, duration and toxicity of algal blooms. A better understanding
   of the evolutionary dynamics of such systems, gained, for example, by
   tracking environmental change in real-time and linking those changes
   with environmental sources of natural selection, could help us predict
   the outbreaks of toxic algae.

   Indeed, there is a growing need in many areas of environmental science
   to efficiently forecast ecosystem change across natural and
   human-induced gradients (Petchey et al., 2015) and to understand the
   consequences of such changes for ecosystem (and evosystem) services
   (Costanza et al., 1997; Rudman et al., 2017). This is particularly
   relevant for ecosystems that provide vital services to society, but are
   also sensitive to anthropogenic impacts. Predictions about complex
   ecological systems are challenging and require solid understanding of
   ecological and evolutionary mechanisms behind population growth,
   genetic and trait diversity, trait-environmental relationships,
   trade-offs, and community dynamics. Such principles are present in the
   environmental science literature, but are only sporadically applied to
   solve environmental issues.

   It is possible that prevailing misconceptions about the pace and
   prevalence of evolution may be blocking the integration of evolution
   into the environmental sciences. First, the pace of evolutionary
   adaptation is not only set by the rate of mutations and the subsequent
   rate of increase of novel alleles in the population. Instead, the rate
   of adaptation, i.e. the increase in mean population fitness over time,
   is directly proportional to the genetic variance in a population that
   can respond to natural selection (Fisher, 1930). evolution from
   existing levels of heritable trait variation in a population can be
   much quicker and more predictable than expected based on evolution
   driven via new variants in the population that arise solely by
   mutation. Second, evolution is neither rare nor a special case. The
   challenge for environmental science is to determine the relative
   importance of evolution, either for causing or for ameliorating a
   particular environmental problem.

   Overall, we argue that evolutionary principles are a useful resource
   for coming up with solutions to environmental problems. On the one
   hand, seemingly rational solutions might require some ‘evolution
   proofing’ to effectively anticipate and limit any potential negative
   impacts of evolution on the expected outcomes of our interventions. On
   the other hand, evolution itself can be a powerful design strategy for
   solving environmental problems. Design by directed evolution, for
   example, has made considerable progress developing novel enzymes
   (Arnold, 1998), and configuring communities to perform specific
   functions that improve environmental conditions (Ghoul and Mitri,
   2016). Natural selection is a powerful force that can efficiently
   explore the combinatorial trait space that organisms could
   theoretically occupy. The trait space of living systems is replete with
   opportunities to solve environmental problems, and natural selection
   might often outpace our own ability to find these solutions. Perhaps a
   way forward is to relinquish our engineering hubris in favor of a
   problem solving strategy that is either informed by, or directed by,
   evolution. Environmental science has a rich history of
   interdisciplinarity. A stronger integration with evolutionary biology
   would improve our ability to address global societal challenges in
   general (Carroll et al., 2014), and environmental challenges in
   particular.

Abstract

Background

   Although personal, familial, and community conflict with evolution have
   been documented in the literature, these scales require
   conceptualization as a construct and operationalization as a measure.
   The Scales of Conflict with evolution Measure (SECM) instrument was
   developed in response to these needs. Using a construct validity
   framework, the content, internal structure, convergent, and substantive
   validity of the SECM were evaluated using Rasch analysis, Structural
   Equation Modeling (SEM), and follow up questioning. The conceptual
   utility of the instrument was explored by examining whether it added
   explanatory insights into evolution acceptance above and beyond
   religiosity, evolution knowledge, and background variables.

Results

   A literature review and expert consultation indicated that construct
   of evolutionary conflict perception should (i) encompass the
   hierarchical nature of human social structures (personal, family,
   community) and (ii) probe conflict as it relates to human values,
   cultures, and beliefs. A three-dimensional construct was
   operationalized as a nine-item rating scale measure. Using Rasch
   analyses of SECM responses from a diverse sample of >gt; 1000 students
   studying evolution, the instrument met criteria of robust measurement,
   including: fit to model expectations; three-dimensional structure; high
   reliability; good rating scale function; measurement invariance with
   time; and convergence with a similar construct. SEM showed that: (i)
   family and community conflict had unique causal contributions to
   personal conflict, with family showing a stronger and modest impact,
   and (ii) personal conflict had a significant and modest causal impact
   on evolution acceptance above and beyond the contributions of
   religiosity, evolution knowledge, and background variables.

Conclusion

   The SECM is an easy-to-administer instrument to measure conflict with
   evolution and is supported by several forms of validity evidence. The
   SECM has potential for facilitating measurement of
   evolutionary conflict in educational settings, thereby raising
   instructor awareness of conflict levels in students, promoting rigorous

Introduction

   The idea that individuals may harbor feelings of conflict with
   evolutionary principles, and that such conflict may be linked to their
   acceptance of evolution, has been discussed in the literature for
   decades (e.g., Clough 1994; Dagher and BouJaoude 1997; Graves 2019;
   Nehm et al. 2009; Scharmann and Harris 1992; Turner 1978). Many
   qualitative studies (and a few quantitative ones) confirm that feelings
   of conflict are an important variable to consider in the complex web of
   factors accounting for evolution acceptance (e.g., Barnes et al. 2020;
   Clough 1994; Ha et al. 2012; Konnemann et al. 2018; Nehm et al. 2009;
   Scharmann and Harris 1992). Conflict with evolution may be
   characterized in many ways: by its presence (i.e., yes, no), magnitude
   (high, low), sources (e.g., religion, societal implications), scales
   (e.g., personal, family, community), and consequences (e.g., anxiety,
   avoidance) (Barnes et al. 2020; Clough 1994; Dagher and BouJaoude 1997;
   Konnemann et al. 2018; Mead et al. 2015; Nehm et al. 2009; Rissler et
   al. 2014; Scharmann and Harris 1992). Despite widespread recognition of
   its importance for evolution education research and practice, only a
   few studies in evolution education have empirically quantified conflict
   (e.g., Barnes et al. 2020; Konnemann et al. 2018; Nehm and Schonfeld
   2007), which is undoubtedly related to the paucity of
   easy-to-administer assessment tools for this topic (cf. Nehm and Mead
   2019). Developing robust measures of conflict with evolutionary ideas
   could: facilitate more frequent measurement in educational settings,
   raise instructor awareness of conflict levels in students, and foster
   rigorous evaluations of educational interventions designed to reduce
   conflict (e.g., Ha et al. 2015; Nehm et al. 2009; Scharmann and Harris
   1992). Such a measure could also lead to conceptual advances in the
   field of evolution education, as discussed below.

   First, feelings of conflict may impact evolution acceptance in ways
   that have not been precisely accounted for in prior work. For example,
   religiosity and evolution knowledge are commonly explored contributors
   to evolution acceptance (Mead et al. 2015; e.g., Bailey et al. 2011;
   Barone et al. 2014; Dagher and BouJaoude 1997; Deniz et al. 2008; Dunk
   et al. 2017; Glaze et al. 2014; Heddy and Nadelson 2013; Lombrozo et
   al. 2008; Paz-y-Minos and Espinosa 2009; 2011; Nehm et al. 2009;
   Sinclair et al. 1997; Truong et al. 2018). Indeed, some researchers
   have suggested that religiosity is the greatest predictor of acceptance
   (e.g., Barnes and Brownell 2017; Glaze et al. 2014; Rissler et al.
   2014). However, while it has been shown that individuals may be
   conflicted about evolution because of their religious beliefs and
   cultures, they may also be conflicted for many other reasons (and
   religious respondents may not be conflicted at all). Nehm et al.
   (2009), for example, found that conflict with evolution had only a
   modest relationship with religiosity and was more strongly associated
   with degree of acceptance (Nehm et al. 2009). Additionally,
   cross-cultural studies in non-religious societies (e.g., China) have
   found only moderate levels of overall evolution acceptance (Ha et al.
   2019). Studies such as these indicate that the relationships between
   religiosity and acceptance require further scrutiny. This work also
   suggests that conflict with evolution has the potential to be important
   as (i) a mediator of the relationship between evolution acceptance and
   religiosity, and (ii) a unique explanatory factor of acceptance that
   encompasses a more expansive range of conflict measures beyond those
   related to religiosity.

   Second, broadening the scope of conflict measurement (i.e., perceived
   family and community conflict with evolution in addition to personal
   conflict) could reveal contributors to personal conflict as well as
   their interrelationships. Prior work suggests that the attitudes
   perceived to be held by members of one’s social groups (e.g., family,
   friends, teachers, church members) impact personal conflict with–and
   acceptance of–evolution (e.g., Barnes et al. 2017b; Donnelly et al.
   2009; Hill 2014; Winslow et al. 2011). Affinity towards certain social
   groups (e.g., one’s community) could therefore be an important
   contributor to one’s personal conflict with evolution (e.g., personal
   level conflict). Individuals could have different causes of personal
   conflict (e.g., familial, community, religiosity, low evolution
   knowledge, combinations thereof), which could in turn contribute to
   different magnitudes of perceived conflict and evolution acceptance.
   Measuring perceptions of conflict at the family and community scale
   could therefore help to reveal important and measurable indirect causes
   of the observed differences in evolution acceptance that have been
   documented among demographic groups (see Bailey et al. 2011; Metzger et
   al. 2018; Sbeglia and Nehm 2018). In other words, it is possible that
   variables such as race or gender could moderate the strength of the
   relationship between community conflict (or family conflict) and
   personal conflict. Furthermore, by including multiple hypothesized
   causes of conflict (many of which may be correlated with each other)
   into an appropriate model, it would reveal their unique impacts on
   personal conflict, and could show that religiosity alone has a smaller
   relationship (direct or indirect) with evolution acceptance than is
   currently thought. Therefore, the SECM allows researchers to test if a
   respondent’s social relationships are additional important contributors
   (direct or indirect) to personal conflict and evolution acceptance.
   Overall, much more needs to be known about perceptions of personal,
   familial, and community conflict and their potential interactions with
   other variables.

   In summary, greater understanding of the scales of conflict with
   evolutionary ideas has potential for advancing conceptual understanding
   within the evolution education research community and for enhancing
   educational practices and outcomes relating to evolution (e.g.,
   reducing student conflict magnitudes). The Scale of evolutionary
   Conflict Measure (SECM) was developed as a first step towards advancing
   work in this area. Below we begin with a description of the conceptual
   framework for measurement, and continue with the corresponding
   conceptual framework for conflict that guided development of the SECM
   instrument.

Conceptual framework: measurement

   evolution education researchers have approached the measurement of
   latent constructs (like conflict) from different conceptual and
   methodological perspectives (see Nehm and Mead 2019). Indeed, many
   types of reliability and validity evidence may be used to support
   claims about what evolution education instruments are able to measure
   (Campbell and Nehm 2013; Messick 1995). Validity and reliability
   evidence for the SECM was gathered in alignment with the Standards for
   Educational and Psychological Testing (AERA et al. 2014); reliability
   refers to the degree to which instrument measures are replicable,
   stable, and free from error, and validity refers to the degree to which
   evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores for the
   proposed uses of tests.

   Different conceptual frameworks exist for validity. This study adopted
   a construct validity framework, which encompasses the gathering of
   evidence in alignment with several separate but interrelated categories
   (Messick 1995; Campbell and Nehm 2013; AERA et al. 2014), specifically:
   (i) evidence based on test content (i.e., content validity), evidence
   based on internal structure (i.e., internal structure validity); (iii)
   evidence based on relationships to other variables (i.e., convergent
   and/or discriminant validity); (iv) evidence based on response
   processes (i.e., substantive validity); (v) validity generalization
   (i.e., generalization validity); and (vi) evidence of consequences.
   Many studies are typically needed to capture the full range of evidence
   needed to establish construct validity. In this study, we investigate
   content validity, internal structure validity, convergent validity, and
   substantive validity.

   To generate evidence based on test content for the SECM, we used a
   literature review and expert judgments to specify the content domain,
   conceptualize the target construct, and operationalize it in the form
   of closed-response items. Content validity addresses the relevance and
   representativeness of test content in light of the intended construct
   (AERA et al. 2014). Evidence for content validity can involve logical
   or empirical analyses of the extent to which the test content
   represents the intended content domain (AERA et al. 2014).

   To generate evidence based on internal structure for the SECM, we used
   Rasch modeling (Campbell and Nehm 2013; see Boone et al. 2014 and Boone
   2017 for digestible introductions into Rasch modeling). Evidence based
   on internal structure addresses how well the instrument generates
   robust measures of the desired latent construct (AERA et al. 2014). A
   latent construct is a feature that cannot be directly observed (e.g.,
   evolution acceptance, perceptions of conflict, religiosity). In order
   to generate robust measurement of a latent construct, specific
   characteristics of the underlying data must be present. These
   characteristics can differ based on the nature of the response data
   (e.g., linear, dichotomous, ordinal, etc.) and the modeling approach
   used, but these criteria must be present for an instrument to be able
   to generate robust measures of the latent construct (Borsboom et al.
   2005). Different modeling approaches are best suited to different types
   of response data. Rasch analysis, and Item Response Theory (IRT) more
   broadly, are the most appropriate approaches for estimating continuous
   latent measures from quantitatively-ordered response data (de Ayala
   2019; Hambleton and Jones 1993; Linacre and Wright 1993; Neumann et al.
   2011).

   To generate evidence based on relationships with other variables, we
   used correlations and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) of
   theoretically associated variables. This form of validity evidence
   addresses the degree to which measures external to the instrument
   relate in a theorized manner (AERA et al. 2014). In this way, evidence
   based on relationships with other variables can support both the
   conceptualization of the construct and interpretations of the test data
   (AERA et al. 2014). External variables may include measures that
   address the same or similar constructs, measures that the test is
   expected to predict or cause, and group membership variables (e.g.,
   race) that have a theorized relationship with the instrument (AERA et
   al. 2014; Mueller and Hancock 2019). Simple correlations may provide
   evidence of associations among theoretically related variables, but
   evaluating hypothesized causal relationships requires a causal modeling
   approach such as SEM. SEM allows researchers to evaluate the extent to
   which the covariances in the instrument-derived data align with (i.e.,
   “fit”) a pre-specified causal hypothesis of how variables should
   interact (Mueller and Hancock 2019). Therefore SEM is a powerful
   approach for testing hypothesized causal relationships about latent
   variables.

Conceptual framework: conflict perception

   Development of the SECM instrument was guided by a conceptual framework
   for conflict perception, which was in turn supported by a literature
   review. Our literature review indicated that conflict perception should
   encompass three core attributes: first, it should consider the
   hierarchical nature of human social structures (personal, family,
   community); second, it should probe perceptions of conflict as it
   relates to variables such as human values, cultures, and beliefs; and
   third, it should not constrain the operationalization of conflict to
   single topics or identities (e.g., those related to religion) given
   that too little is currently known about the diverse array of possible
   ways that conflict with evolution may manifest itself within
   respondents (Brem et al. 2003). We discuss the details of these core
   attributes below.

Scales of conflict: Personal, family, community

   An individual’s perception of conflict with evolution is likely to be
   situated within broader social contexts, and prior work suggests that
   the attitudes that are thought to be held by members of one’s social
   group (e.g., family, friends, teachers, church members) impact personal
   conflict with evolution (e.g., Barnes et al. 2017b; Donnelly et al.
   2009; Hill 2014; Winslow et al. 2011). Barnes et al. (2017b), for
   example, found that parental attitudes towards evolution were strongly
   associated with evolution acceptance. Likewise, Winslow et al. (2011)
   demonstrated that parents, and to a lesser extent church members, were
   strongly associated with personal views of evolution. Hill (2014) found
   that adolescent respondents who identified as religiously-devoted
   creationists were twice as likely to increase acceptance of evolution
   in early adulthood if they had friend networks in which not all members
   shared the respondent’s religious ideal type (religious ideal type is a
   multifaceted construct that includes indicators of religious
   participation, importance of faith in daily life, feelings of closeness
   to God, frequency of prayer, etc.). Hill argued that the amount of
   heterogeneity or homogeneity of religious ideal type within friend
   networks could act to break down or maintain creationist beliefs (Hill
   2014). These studies suggest that the social groups to which
   individuals belong are related to personal conflict and overall
   acceptance of evolution.

   This prior work motivated the conceptualization of the construct
   ‘perception of evolutionary conflict’ at multiple, broadly defined
   social scales, namely: personal, family, and community. These three
   scales seek to capture the diversity of group memberships that a person
   may hold. “Family” is intentionally inclusive, although it typically
   refers to groups that share common ancestry and/or cohabitate, but can
   extend beyond these groups. Definitions of community in the literature
   are designed to encompass many different social groupings (e.g.,
   friends, partners, coworkers, online networks, and groups that share
   common geographies [e.g., neighbors] or common characteristics [e.g.,
   career interest groups, racial or ethnic identities, religious
   affiliations]). Using open-ended interviews and a diverse group of
   respondents (n = 118), MacQueen et al. (2001) reported that community
   was defined similarly by respondents as “a group of people with diverse
   characteristics who are linked by social ties, share common
   perspectives, and engage in joint action in geographical locations or
   settings” (p. 1929). While the associations of family and community
   with perceptions of conflict and evolution acceptance have been
   advanced in the literature, researchers have yet to (i) develop
   measurement instruments that include such relationships or (ii)
   evaluate them in a causal modeling framework. The SECM was designed to
   allow the formal testing of hypotheses related to multiple scales of
   conflict.

Operationalizing perceptions of conflict: belief, culture, values

   For each scale (personal, family, community), the perception of
   conflict with evolution was conceptualized as a construct that can be
   operationalized using several interrelated but distinct variables.
   Three variables from prior work (e.g., Barnes et al. 2017a, b; Brem et
   al. 2003; Dagher and BouJaoude 1997) that may be used to operationalize
   this construct include: (i) the level of conflict with one’s beliefs,
   (ii) the level of conflict with one’s culture, and (iii) the level of
   conflict with one’s values. It is important to note that religious
   identities may encompass all three of these variables; however,
   beliefs, culture, and values may also operate outside of a religious
   context and may be connected to broader aspects of identity. While
   relatively little work has focused on the non-religious aspects of
   beliefs, culture, and values as they relate to evolution acceptance
   (Brem et al. 2003 is an important exception), substantial work has been
   carried out on these elements (and their connections to identity) more
   broadly. Below we provide a brief review of each of these variables.

   Beliefs are considered to be a way of knowing derived from personal
   truths, as opposed to world truths (Smith et al. 1995). Beliefs tend to
   be highly subjective, firmly structured, and unaffected by empirical
   evidence (to the extent they are confronted with it) (Smith et al.,
   1995; Southerland et al. 2001). Students hold beliefs about many
   topics, but religious beliefs in particular have been suggested to be
   strongly associated with perceptions of evolutionary conflict (Barnes
   et al. 2017a, 2017b; Rissler et al. 2014; Truong et al. 2018).
   Religious beliefs refer to the “specific beliefs one holds about the
   existence and influence of a deity” (Barnes and Brownell 2017, p. 3).
   Although evolution is often presented as incompatible with religious
   beliefs (e.g., Coyne 2015; Dawkins 2009), authors have shown that
   interventions designed to highlight their compatibility were associated
   with a reduction in the perception of conflict (e.g., Barnes and
   Brownell 2017; Nehm and Schonfeld 2007; Truong et al. 2018).

   Culture encompasses the values, assumptions, practices, and artifacts
   that are shared within a group, community, or society (Taras et al.
   2009). Culture becomes part of an individual through consistent
   engagement with family and community members (Causadias et al. 2018).
   Thus, culture operates at both the individual and group level in the
   sense that it implies belonging to a social entity that conditions
   one’s experiences (Taras et al. 2009). There are many models of culture
   that emphasize different elements of this construct. For example,
   Gelfand et al. (2006) advanced a model of culture that is based on the
   notion of cultural looseness vs. tightness, which refers to the degree
   to which social norms are enforced within the group. Leung et al.
   (2002) offered a model that describes cultures by their basic
   assumptions about social complexity, spirituality, perceived fate
   control, cynicism, and rewards. A person’s culture may bear on
   perceptions of conflict with evolution if evolutionary theory is viewed
   as incompatible with shared assumptions or norms within their group,
   especially if a particular group enforces strict adherence to these
   norms. In particular, evolutionary ideas have been perceived to be at
   odds with one’s religious culture (defined as “the sociocultural norms
   that individuals experience related to religion.” [Barnes and Brownell
   2017 p. 38]) and this sense of religious cultural conflict need not
   require the perception of a contradiction with one’s religious beliefs
   (Barnes and Brownell 2017). For example, cultural tightness related to
   the literal vs. non-literal interpretations of religious texts could
   explain the association between individuals’ perceptions of conflict
   with evolution and their specific religious affiliation (Dagher and
   BouJaoude 1997). Interventions designed to highlight the compatibility
   between evolutionary ideas and the perceptions of leaders of religious
   communities have been shown to be associated with an increase in
   acceptance (e.g., Manwaring et al. 2015). Other groups may also
   experience conflict related to their group memberships. For example,
   ethnicity and race are intimately related to, or are a part of the
   broader concept of culture (Causadias et al. 2018), and some race
   groups have been found to have lower levels of evolution acceptance
   than others (Bailey et al. 2011; Metzger et al. 2018; Sbeglia and Nehm
   2018). Unfortunately, few studies disaggregate evolution acceptance by
   race (Mead et al. 2015) and it is not currently known how the
   documented differences in acceptance relate to the magnitude or nature
   of perceived conflict with evolution. Nevertheless, although culture is
   known to be an important factor shaping perceptions, the assumption
   that the role of culture is stronger for minority than majority groups
   has been challenged (e.g., Causadias et al. 2018) and investigations
   seeking to explain differences in acceptance should proceed with
   caution.

   Values refer to the ideals that are central to one’s personhood and
   identity (Hitlin 2003). They are a set of concepts or beliefs about
   desirable end states or behaviors that tend to have several important
   features: a) they are trans-situational (i.e., context-independent) and
   often immutable over time, b) they guide the selection of behaviors and
   the evaluation of events, and c) they are (or can be) well-organized
   mental structures that are ordered by their relative importance (Hitlin
   and Piliavin 2004; Michener et al. 2004; Schwartz and Bilsky 1987).
   Therefore, values parameterize perceptions of acceptable or ethical
   behaviors and events, structure interpretations of personal
   experiences, and orient people to their social context (Hitlin and
   Piliavin 2004; Marini 2000). While ideologies (religious or otherwise)
   can overlap with and inform values (Maio et al. 2003), values extend
   beyond individual contexts (e.g., religious or cultural contexts)
   (Hitlin and Piliavin 2004) and more broadly structure views about the
   world. Schwartz (1992; 1994) has empirically evaluated and outlined a
   structure of ten human values that he argues are near-universal. These
   include universalism (“tolerance and concern for welfare of all
   others”), benevolence (“preserve and enhance welfare of those with whom
   one is in frequent personal contact”), and self-direction (“autonomous
   thought and action [idea of agency]”). These values are well-aligned
   with some of the negative perceived societal implications of
   evolutionary theory outlined and observed by Brem et al. (2003),
   including the naive perception that evolution implies a lack of control
   or self-determination and justifies selfishness and racial or ethnic
   discrimination. In one study, for example, the majority (56% and 65%,
   respectively) of college students reported that accepting evolutionary
   ideas makes it easier to justify racism and ethnic discrimination and
   harder to think of people as determining their own fate (Brem et al.
   2003). In summary, the literature supports the roles of beliefs,
   cultures, and values in the conceptualization of perceptions of
   conflict with evolution.

Research questions

   In this paper, we aim to evaluate if the SECM instrument productively
   measures the intended construct. Specifically, we ask:
    1. Does the SECM adhere to well-accepted criteria of robust
       measurement? (1.1) Do the items that comprise the instrument
       display acceptable fit to model expectations? (1.2) Is the
       instrument best modeled as one dimension or three dimensions? (1.3)
       Does the instrument reliably order items by their agreeability, and
       respondents by their measures on the latent trait? (1.4) How
       precisely does the instrument measure the latent trait? (1.5) Does
       the rating scale function as expected? (1.6) Does the instrument
       display measurement invariance pre- and post-instruction?
    2. Are respondents interpreting the items as anticipated?
    3. Are latent SECM measures convergent with measures of similar
       constructs?
    4. Do measures of conflict derived from the SECM contribute to the
       explanation of evolution acceptance above and beyond the
       contributions of religiosity and evolution knowledge?

Materials

Participant sample

   Participants were drawn from two semesters (Fall 2019 and Spring 2020)
   of an introductory biology course at a large, public, research-oriented
   university in the northeastern United States (N = 1179 for the pre-test
   [~ 90% participation rate]). All students were enrolled in introductory
   biology courses in which evolution was a major theme (nearly all units
   connected to evolution in some way). Participants were asked to self
   report background characteristics including age, gender, ethnicity or
   racial identity (White, Asian, or underrepresented minority [URM,
   including Black/African American, American Indian/Alaska Native,
   Hispanic of any race, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Island]), whether
   English was their first language, and self-rated reading and writing
   ability (as an indication of English language proficiency—scale ranges
   from very poor to excellent). Academic information collected included
   undergraduate class standing (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior),
   plan (biology, Non-Bio STEM [science, technology, engineering, or
   mathematics], non-STEM), and prior biology coursework. Participant
   demographic and background information is summarized in Table
   ​Table1.1. The sample of students included both majors and non-majors
   and had representation from diverse backgrounds (in terms of race,
   ethnicity, and gender [see Table ​Table1]).1]). The sample was also
   chosen because evolution was a core idea in the courses, and
   accordingly was anticipated to spur thinking about evolution. In both
   semesters, the nature of science and evolution instruction occurred
   within the first few weeks of the semester. The pre-survey took place
   during the nature of science unit but before the evolution unit.

Instrument development

   A literature review as well as faculty experts from two fields
   (evolution education and social psychology) were used to conceptualize
   a three-scale construct (i.e., perceptions of personal, family, and
   community conflict), each of which was operationalized using three
   closed-response items designed to capture perceptions of conflict at
   each scale between evolutionary ideas and (i) values, (ii) culture, and
   (iii) beliefs (n = 9 items total). Specifically, each of the nine items
   of the SECM had the following structure:

   Stem: evolutionary ideas are at odds or in conflict with…

   Scale: …[my, my family’s, my community’s]…

   Variable: …[culture, values, beliefs].

   The stem was derived from Nehm and Schonfeld (2007)’s conflict measure
   and is common to all items; every combination of scale and variable was
   designed to compose the full 3-scale instrument. The items have a
   five-option response format (strongly agree [SA], agree [A], neutral
   [N], disagree [D], and strongly disagree [SD]). Responses were coded
   from 0–4, with 4 representing the highest perceived conflict. See the

Administration and data sources

   We administered a survey to students at the beginning and end of the
   semester in Fall 2019 and the beginning of the semester in Spring 2020.
   The survey included instruments that measure perceptions of evolution
   conflict (SECM), evolution acceptance (Inventory of Student evolution
   Acceptance [I-SEA], Nadelson and Southerland, 2012), evolution
   knowledge (Conceptual Assessment of Natural Selection [CANS],
   Kalinowski et al. 2016), religiosity (Cohen et al. 2008), and
   compatibility perception (Inclusion of Others in Self [IOS] measure,
   Aron et al. 1992). After collecting response data, we evaluated the
   reliability, item fit, and dimensionality of each instrument using
   Rasch analysis (see methods section for details on Rasch analysis).
   There were no missing data for any of the instruments, but 21
   respondents had missing background data and were excluded from relevant
   analyses. We describe the I-SEA, CANS, IOS, and religiosity instruments
   below.

I-SEA

   The I‐SEA measures evolution acceptance (Nadelson and Southerland
   2012). It contains three item sets (eight items each, 24 total), each
   representing a different evolutionary scale or taxon: microevolution,
   macroevolution, and human evolution. The scale and taxonomic
   differences among item sets may be considered surface features that are
   irrelevant to expert-like evolutionary reasoning (Nehm and Ha 2011).
   The items have a five‐option response format (strongly disagree [SD],
   disagree [D], undecided [U], agree [A], and strongly agree [SA]).
   Responses were coded from 0–4, with 4 representing the highest
   evolution acceptance. Items with negative valences were reverse-coded
   as appropriate. When necessary, adjacent categories were collapsed for
   those items in which one or more categories lacked responses. Existing
   validity evidence includes content validity (e.g., student and expert
   interviews, Nadelson and Southerland, 2012), and internal
   structure validity evidence (e.g., Rasch-based fit statistics,
   reliabilities, item functioning, dimensionality analysis, pre-post
   instruction changes; Sbeglia and Nehm 2019).

CANS

   The CANS measures knowledge of natural selection (Kalinowski et al.
   2016). The instrument contains 24 multiple choice items presented in
   clusters that focus on specific taxa: anteaters, whales, cacti,
   mosquitos. The instrument’s authors chose to organize the instrument by
   taxon to allow students to reason across biological contexts, and to
   address misconceptions best suited to particular cases (e.g., role of
   use and disuse, evolution in plants vs. animals, evolution in relation
   to human disease; see Nehm et al. 2012). Some of the item clusters
   contain items that are parallel in form but differ in taxon. The items
   have one correct answer and were coded such that incorrect responses
   were recorded as a “0” and correct responses as a “1”. Existing
   validity evidence includes content validity (e.g., student interviews
   and expert reviews) and internal structure validity (e.g., IRT-based
   fit statistics, reliabilities, pre-post instruction changes)
   (Kalinowski et al. 2016).

Religiosity

   The religiosity instrument was developed by Cohen et al. (2008). The
   instrument contains nine items, seven of which ask about the
   respondent’s religious identity, and two of which ask about the
   respondent’s religious participation. The items have a five‐option
   response format (i.e., strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and
   strongly agree). Responses were coded from 0–4, with 4 representing the
   highest religiosity. Existing validity evidence includes internal
   structure validity (e.g., reliability) and convergent validity (Cohen
   et al. 2008).

IOS

   The IOS measure is designed to evaluate how closely (or compatible)
   respondents felt to another person or group (Aron et al. 1992). In the
   original conceptualization of the instrument, respondents are presented
   with seven pairs of circles that varied in degree of overlap. One
   circle in each pair would be labeled “self,” and the second circle was
   labeled as some other group. The instrument has been adapted to study a
   variety of domains (e.g., Aron et al. 1992; Clark et al. 2016; Shin et
   al. 2016; Tropp and Wright 2001). Existing validity evidence for this
   instrument includes internal structure validity (e.g., alternate-form
   and test–retest reliability), convergent validity, and external
   structure validity (e.g., relationships with other variables) (Aron et
   al. 1992). We modified the instrument to measure respondents' perceived
   compatibility between their family and evolution ideas (Fig. 2).
   Respondents in our sample were asked, “Which of the 7 pictures below
   best describes how compatible you think your family is with
   evolutionary ideas and concepts?”.

Methods

RQ1: Does the SECM adhere to well-accepted criteria of robust measurement?

   To address RQ1, we modeled each scale using an approach that is
   appropriate for the type of response data (i.e., ordered) and the
   structure of the latent construct (i.e., continuous). For each of these
   considerations, Rasch analysis is appropriate (de Ayala 2019; Liu
   2010). Specifically, we modeled the SECM using a partial credit Rasch
   model (i.e., item + item*step, PCM2 in TAM) with the R package Test
   Analysis Modules (TAM, v. 2.10–24, Robitzsch et al. 2018). Rasch
   analysis, and IRT more generally, estimates respondents' latent
   measures using a probabilistic approach, and thus does not claim to
   measure a true score. Rather, a respondent’s likelihood of selecting a
   particular response is based on the difference between a respondent’s
   measure on the trait and each item’s level of agreeability (or
   difficulty). These approaches theorize that in order to generate robust
   measures of a latent construct, the following characteristics of the
   underlying data must be present: (1) acceptable item fit, (2)
   acceptable rating scale functioning, (3) unidimensionality, (4)
   acceptable item and person reliability, (5) acceptable person-item
   alignment (Wright maps), and (6) measurement invariance (Boone 2017;
   Boone et al. 2014). These six criteria may be considered a benchmark
   for productive measurement using the Rasch model, and if met, suggest
   that the instrument can generate robust measures of the latent
   construct (Borsboom et al. 2005). Here, “measures” refers to both an
   item measure (i.e., the agreeability or difficulty of an item) and a
   person measure (i.e., the agreeability or ability of a person). Item
   and person measures are on the same logit scale and can be compared to
   each other (Boone et al. 2014). In Rasch analysis, unlike IRT, the item
   measure is the only parameter considered in the calculation of the
   person measure (using a weighted maximum likelihood estimation [WLE] of
   the item parameter). IRT models, on the other hand, also include other
   parameters that can be added or removed to improve the fit of the
   model. Rasch analysis assumes that no additional parameters are needed
   for productive measurement of a latent construct (Boone et al. 2014).
   Therefore, although Rasch analysis and IRT are considered to be
   conceptually different approaches, the Rasch model is mathematically
   equivalent to a 1-parameter (1PL) IRT model (Boone et al. 2014). A
   benefit of the strict 1-parameter assumption of the Rasch model is that
   it calibrates instruments using an equivalent standard (Romine et al.
   2017); the probability of selecting a particular level of conflict for
   an item is proportional only to the difference between the agreeability
   of the item and the level of conflict of the respondent. Furthermore,
   this approach converts raw, ordered data to a continuous linear scale,
   making Rasch and IRT measures suitable for parametric statistical
   analyses. We briefly summarize each of these evaluation criteria below.

Item fit

   To address if the items that compose the instrument have an acceptable
   fit to model expectations (RQ 1.1), we analyzed the
   information-weighted (i.e., Infit) and unweighted (i.e., Outfit, which
   is sensitive to outliers) mean squares fit (MNSQ) statistics for each
   item. In alignment with psychometric standards, we considered MNSQ fit
   values of 0.5–1.5 logits to be acceptable (Boone et al. 2014). Fit
   values that were slightly outside this range indicate that an item does
   not meaningfully contribute to measurement, and values >gt; 2 indicate
   that the item is degrading to measurement (Boone et al. 2014).

Rating scale functioning

   To evaluate if the rating scale of the SECM functions as expected
   (RQ1.5), we used two approaches. First, we examined the correspondence
   between the participants’ answer choices and their overall Rasch person
   measures (Boone et al. 2014; Sbeglia and Nehm 2018, 2019).
   Well-functioning items should have a high correspondence. In the second
   approach, we examined the Rasch-Andrich thresholds (also called step
   parameters or Andrich deltas), which represent the locations on the
   Rasch category probability curve where the curves for adjacent answer
   options meet, and indicate the point at which there is a 50%
   probability of selecting adjacent answer categories (Linacre 1999).
   Thresholds that are close together, or not in the expected sequential
   order (e.g., “strongly agree”, “disagree, agree”), are said to be
   disordered. Depending upon the cause of the anomaly, threshold disorder
   may or may not indicate that the item is unable to predictably
   discriminate abilities on the latent trait (Adams et al. 2012; Andrich
   2013; Boone et al. 2014). Collectively, we used rating scale
   functioning and item fit to assess the overall functioning and
   appropriateness of each item in the SECM.

Dimensionality

   The items of an instrument must measure only one construct or topic
   (i.e. be unidimensional) in order for the resulting latent measures to
   indicate the relative position of respondents along the same trait.
   Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the dimensionality of the item
   sets. We conducted two analyses to determine if the instrument is best
   modeled as one dimension (all conflict scales combined) or three
   dimensions (each scale on a separate dimension) (RQ1.2). First, we used
   a principal components analysis (PCA) of the residuals from a
   unidimensional Rasch model to evaluate patterns of unexplained
   variance. If the eigenvalue of the first contrast is greater than 2, it
   indicates sufficient unexplained variation among the residuals to
   suggest the possibility of additional, unmodeled dimensions (Boone et
   al. 2014). We also plotted the eigenvalue of the first PCA contrast
   against the agreeability of each item to visualize the pattern of
   shared unexplained variation among items. Items that cluster together
   can be hypothesized to represent a distinct dimension. This approach
   allows additional dimensions to be discovered based on patterns of
   unexplained variation.

   Second, we used a likelihood ratio test to compare the relative fit of
   unidimensional and multidimensional models of the response data to
   Rasch expectations (see Robitzsch et al. 2018). In this approach,
   dimensions are hypothesized a priori and the resulting models are
   tested for data-model fit.

Item and person reliability

   Item reliability quantifies the extent to which the instrument is able
   to consistently order items by their difficulties, and may be measured
   using expected a posteriori/plausible value reliability values (EAP/PV)
   (Bond and Fox 2001). Person reliability quantifies the extent to which
   an instrument is able to order respondents based on their abilities,
   which can be measured using Warm's Mean Weighted Likelihood Estimates
   (WLE) (Bond and Fox 2001). Reliabilities range from 0 to 1 and can be
   interpreted much like Cronbach’s alpha (Boone et al. 2017). Values >gt;
   0.70 are acceptable (Grigg and Manderson 2016; Yang et al. 2017).
   Collectively, these measures indicate the ability of the instrument to
   reliably order items by their agreeability and respondents by their
   level on the latent trait (RQ1.3).

Person-Item alignment

   The alignment of an instrument to the sample in which it was
   administered indicates the level of measurement precision the
   instrument can achieve. Precise measurement occurs when the
   agreeability of items or of the categories on the rating scale (for
   polytomous items) span the full spectrum of respondent abilities, and
   precision declines when the items and respondents are less aligned.
   Items or categories that differ in agreeability act like tick marks on
   a ruler that allow you to bin respondents based on their abilities. The
   fewer distinct tick marks on the ruler, the fewer bins respondents can
   populate, and the lower the precision of measurement. To measure how
   precisely the SECM measures the latent trait (RQ1.4), we visualized
   person-item alignment using Wright maps. Wright maps plot Rasch item
   difficulties against Rasch person measures. If the instrument is
   polytomous (i.e., not dichotomous) in nature, Thurstonian thresholds
   for each rating scale category may also be plotted for each item.
   Thurstonian thresholds are the locations on the Wright map where a
   respondent has a 50% probability of selecting a particular answer
   category (or higher) for an item. For this format of instrument, item
   agreeability is the mean of the Thurstonian thresholds (see Sbeglia and
   Nehm 2019 for more detail). Respondents with high abilities on the
   latent trait are positioned at the top of the Wright map. Likewise,
   items and thresholds with the highest agreeabilities are also
   positioned at the top of the map, which reflects their high
   agreeability because top students only have a 50% probability of
   choosing a given answer (less able students have lower probabilities).

Measurement invariance

   Measurement invariance describes situations in which the underlying
   measurement structure of an instrument (e.g., item
   descrimination/factor loadings, item thresholds, residual variances,
   dimensionality) remains stable through time (or across groups) (van de
   Schoot et al. 2015). While test respondents are often expected to show
   a change in their amount of a particular latent trait through time
   (e.g., knowledge of evolution before and after taking a biology
   course), the underlying measurement structure of the instrument must
   remain stable in order for a comparison of latent measures to be
   meaningful (Lommen et al. 2014). To establish if the SECM displayed
   measurement invariance pre- to post-instruction (RQ1.6), we conducted a
   differential item functioning (DIF) analysis on the SECM items. An item
   displays DIF when respondents with equal abilities, but from different
   groups or time points, differ in their expected responses for the item.
   An item has “non-DIF” if respondents with equal abilities have the same
   expected response, regardless of group or time. A finding of “non-DIF”
   from the pre- to the post-survey would suggest measurement invariance,
   and thus allow for the meaningful comparison of SECM measures across
   time. DIF may be calculated by running a multifaceted Rasch model in
   which the variable being examined (the facet, in this case time) is
   modeled as having an interaction with each item (Robitzsch et al.
   2018). To evaluate the significance of DIF, the absolute value of the
   t-ratio for the interaction parameter must be greater than 2. If the
   SECM does not exhibit DIF from pre-to post-course, it may be considered
   to have measurement invariance, and therefore pre-post comparisons can
   be meaningfully made.

RQ2. Are respondents interpreting items as anticipated?

   In order to gather evidence to test the claim that respondents were
   interpreting SECM items as anticipated (i.e., substantive validity
   evidence), a sample of 619 students completing the SECM were also asked
   to answer a follow-up question. This question was used to examine the
   correspondence between the intended interpretation of the “community”
   item and participants’ actual definitions of community. After answering
   the “community” item, respondents were asked to select the specific
   groups that they considered to be part of their community. Each
   respondent was allowed to choose and rank a maximum of three of the
   following options, or no option at all: (1) My friends at college, (2)
   My friends from high school, (3) My significant other or partner, (4)
   People in my major or professional track, (5) People from my race
   group, (6) People from my neighborhood, (7) People from my church or
   who share my religion, (8) People from my place of work, and (9) People
   from my online social network. The first choice was indicated as the
   choice most important to one’s community.

   We performed two analyses. First, we analyzed the correspondence of our
   intended interpretation of the community item (see above) and
   participants’ actual chosen definitions by evaluating the proportion of
   the sample that selected “Not applicable” for one or more of the three
   specific community categories. This response was interpreted as
   indicating that the categories of community defined in our conceptual
   framework and offered to students were not well-matched to their
   definition of community. Second, we analyzed if respondents defined
   their communities similarly to one another by evaluating if a subset of
   categories were more frequently selected than others, and if this
   pattern differed by conflict level. A 2-sample z-test was used to test
   for the equality of proportions between high and low conflict
   respondents. For this analysis, respondents were separated into high
   and low conflict categories based on whether their Rasch measures were
   above or below the population’s mean conflict level. Overall, these
   analyses on a large sample were used to test the claim that respondents
   were interpreting the item as anticipated and that respondents from
   different conflict groups were interpreting the features of the items
   as designed. We use a critical p-value of 0.01 for all analyses.

RQ3: Are latent SECM measures convergent with measures of similar constructs?

   To address RQ3, we correlated latent measures of each respondent’s
   perception of their family’s conflict with evolution ideas (i.e., SECM
   Family item set) with the modified IOS item using a Spearman
   correlation. As described above, the modified IOS item asked about
   perceived compatibility between respondents’ families and their
   evolutionary ideas.

RQ4: Does the SECM contribute to the explanation of evolution acceptance
above and beyond the contributions of religiosity and evolution knowledge?

   To address RQ4, we shifted our approach from a Rasch framework to a
   Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) framework. Whereas Rasch or IRT is a
   preferred approach when the test and its categorical items are the
   focus of study (Wright 1996), Latent variable path analysis (LVPA, a
   SEM method) is preferred when modeling putative causal relationships
   among latent variables (Mueller and Hancock 2019). LVPA models include
   a measurement component and a structural (i.e., theoretical) component.
   The measurement component of a LVPA is akin to a confirmatory factor
   analysis (CFA), which models latent traits based on the patterns of
   covariation among its items (i.e., measured variables). CFA and IRT are
   similar in this regard (though modeling assumptions may differ).
   However, CFA fits within a broader path analysis framework, in which
   the measurement model is situated within a structural model of causal
   relationships among variables. Though CFA and LVPA are traditionally
   reserved for traits with continuous items (not Likert scale items as in
   the SECM) due to the use of maximum likelihood estimation (Wright
   1996), recent work has resulted in the development of more flexible
   estimation approaches, including those appropriate for ordered
   categorical data (e.g., diagonally weighted least squares [DWLS] and
   its robust variants [e.g., WLSMV]) (Rosseel 2020).

   SEM allows the testing of a priori theory-driven hypotheses, and is not
   designed to generate hypotheses post-hoc (or to model hypotheses
   derived from previous exploration of the same data set) (Mueller and
   Hancock 2019). Therefore, the theoretical framework underlying the
   model being tested must be articulated and justified, which we do in
   the following section (see section titled Theoretical framework for
   SECM factor and item relationships). Using this theoretical framework,
   which seeks to outline how SECM factors and items may relate to each
   other, we built a structural model using LVPA in the R program Lavaan
   v. 0.6-6 (Rosseel 2020a). However, this particular theoretical
   framework need not be adopted in order to use the SECM, and we
   encourage continued discussion on the appropriateness of our proposed
   relationships.

Theoretical framework for SECM factor and item relationships

   Individuals who experience personal conflict with normative scientific
   ideas do so because of the ways in which they perceive or process
   relevant information and events. These perceptions (along with
   perceptions more generally) may be linked to a person’s group
   memberships and resulting social identities (Xiao et al. 2016; Kahan et
   al. 2007). For example, individuals who identify themselves as being
   members of a particular group may align their perceptions and
   perspectives with those of the group (Kahan et al. 2007), which is a
   phenomenon that has been explicitly connected to evolution acceptance,
   evolution rejection, and science denial more broadly (Walker et al.
   2017^1). Furthermore, exposures to social groups during
   human development are thought to calibrate peoples' perceptual systems
   (Xiao et al. 2016), possibly forming cognitive models that can be
   broadly applied across contexts. Therefore, we propose that aspects of
   social identity (e.g., the ideas and perspectives held by the social
   group with which one identifies) may have a causal relationship with
   one’s personal perceptions of conflict with evolution. Other aspects of
   identity (e.g., one’s values, cultures, and beliefs) may be indicative
   of (i.e. manifestations of) one’s latent level of perceived conflict
   with evolution.

Description of the measurement model

   Before implementing a structural model that aligns with the theoretical
   framework for SECM factor and item relationships (described above), we
   first evaluated the fit of the measurement model. The measurement model
   is the part of the model that relates the items (i.e., measured
   variables) with the factors (i.e., latent variables). A
   well-fitting measurement model establishes that each factor and
   its associated items acceptably measures the intended construct. Once a
   well-fitting measurement model is established, hypothesized causal
   paths among factors may be modeled and evaluated. In a measurement
   model, factors are linked to their associated items and all factors (or
   their residuals [i.e., disturbances] if the factors are endogenous) are
   allowed to covary with each other (Mueller and Hancock 2019).
   Next, theory should be used to model covariances between the residual
   variance (i.e., error variance) of appropriate items.  Error variance
   is the part of the measured variable that does not relate to the
   factor. If two items have something in common that is not captured by
   the factor, then their error variances may be correlated with each
   other (Rosseel 2020b). In order for the measurement model to fit the
   underlying data, possible error covariances among the items must be
   considered a priori using theory, and then modeled. Below we detail how
   we modeled each latent trait in the measurement model.

   In alignment with the conceptual framework for conflict perception (see
   introduction) and the theoretical framework for SECM factor and item
   relationships (see methods above), the SECM was modeled as three
   factors, one for each scale of conflict. For each factor, the items
   (i.e., the culture, values, and belief items) were modeled as
   indicators (i.e., a reflective relationship between the latent trait
   and the measured variables [see Mikulić and Ryan 2018 for more on
   reflective vs. formative models]). Error covariances were modeled among
   items from different SECM factors that had parallel forms (e.g., the
   error variances of the three items about “values” were allowed to
   covary). The CANS was modeled as one factor and error covariances
   were modeled among items with parallel forms, and among items that
   focused on the same taxon. Taxon is a feature of instrument items that
   has been hypothesized to impact evolutionary reasoning and test
   performance (Kalinowski et al. 2016; Opfer et al. 2012). The I-SEA was
   modeled as three factors (microevolution, macroevolution, and human
   evolution) as recommended by the instrument’s authors (Nadelson and
   Southerland, 2012), and error covariances were modeled among items with
   negative valence, among items about human microevolution, and among
   items about human macroevolution, all of which have been hypothesized
   as possible additional dimensions within the instrument (see Sbeglia
   and Nehm 2019). Religiosity was modeled as one factor and error
   covariance was modeled between the two religious participation items.
   Background variables (i.e., plan, prior biology coursework, level, ELL
   status, reading and writing ability, gender, race) were also included
   in this model. All factors were allowed to covary. Modification indices
   were run and evaluated for possible theory-based changes to the model.
   We used the WLSMV estimator, which allowed all indicators to be modeled
   as ordered. Given an acceptable data-model fit for the measurement
   model, the structural portion of the model could then be estimated (van
   Riper and Kyle 2014).

Description of the structural model

   Structural models are built from measurement models, but in structural
   models, only theoretically important paths are retained. Theoretically
   important paths are those that align with the theoretical framework for
   factor and item relationships laid out by the researcher. Specifically,
   in line with our theoretical framework for SECM factor and item
   relationships, we built a LVPA model with the following features: The
   latent traits of family and community conflict perception were modeled
   as being causal to personal conflict perception, and personal conflict
   perception was modeled as causal to the three scales of evolution
   acceptance. Family and community conflict were allowed to covary and
   the three factors of evolution acceptance were allowed to covary.
   Background variables (i.e., plan, prior biology coursework, level, ELL
   status, reading and writing ability, gender, race), evolution
   knowledge, and religiosity were modeled as having structural paths to
   all factors within the model, which removes the linear effects of these
   variables on parameter estimates (i.e., it controls for them) (Mueller
   and Hancock 2019). This model is visualized in the results section.
   With these controls in place, we estimated the significance of the
   causal paths among the scales of conflict, and between the personal
   conflict and the scales of evolution acceptance by generating
   asymptotic standard errors of parameter estimates using the Delta
   method (Rosseel 2020b). This analysis allowed the investigation of the
   unique contribution of the causal paths between the SECM and evolution
   acceptance, above and beyond religiosity and evolution knowledge (RQ3).

Fit statistics

   We used the following fit statistics and cutoffs: root mean square
   error of approximation (RMSEA) <lt; 0.05, standardized root mean square
   residual (SRMR) <lt; 0.08, and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) >gt; 0.95 (Mueller
   and Hancock 2019). If a model has acceptable fit, then the parameters
   are considered interpretable.

Results

   The mean of raw SECM scores was 1.99/6 (sd = 2.09) for personal
   conflict, 2.60/6 (sd = 2.42) for family conflict, and 2.51/6 (sd =
   2.16) for community conflict. The three faculty experts in evolution
   education and social psychology agreed that the items in the SECM were
   clearly worded and appropriately connected to and representative of the
   construct and the existing literature. The mean raw score of the I-SEA
   was 26.57/32 (sd = 4.5) for microevolution, 25.62/32 (sd = 4.24) for
   macroevolution, and 24.69/32 (sd = 5.52) for human evolution. The mean
   raw score for the CANS was 10.69/24 (sd = 4.68), and religiosity was
   15.97/36 (sd = 10.18). Below we answer each of our research questions
   about the SECM. See Additional file 1: Table S1 for a summary of the
   psychometric properties of the I-SEA, CANS, and religiosity instrument.

RQ1: Does the SECM adhere to well-accepted criteria of robust measurement?

   We used responses on the SECM to model evolutionary conflict perception
   as a one-dimensional and as a three-dimensional construct (i.e., a
   separate construct for personal conflict, family conflict, and
   community conflict). For both construct formulations, Rasch fit
   statistics indicated that the items were generally productive for
   measurement and no items were degrading to measurement. A PCA of Rasch
   residuals generated by the one-dimensional model indicated substantial
   unexplained variation (eigenvalue of the first contrast = 3.33) and
   clustered items according to the scale of conflict (i.e., personal,
   family, community), not according to the variable (i.e., values,
   culture, beliefs) (Fig. 3). A likelihood ratio test confirmed that a
   three-dimensional model (in which each scale of conflict was modeled as
   its own construct) was a significantly better fit to the data than a
   one-dimensional model (X^2 = 2578.54, df = 5, p <lt; 0.001; AIC[1D] =
   21,356.93, AIC[3D] = 18,788.39; BIC[1D] = 21,544.57, BIC[3D] =
   19,001.39). When modeled as three separate one-dimensional models, the
   item fit was acceptable and productive for all items (Table
   ​(Table2),2), the PCA of Rasch residuals indicated little unexplained
   variation (eigenvalue of the first contrast = 1.75–1.8).

   The SECM demonstrated acceptable precision and high reliability in its
   measurement of perceptions of conflict with evolution. The Wright map
   indicated that respondents were variable in their latent levels of the
   construct at all scales, and the Thurstonian thresholds spanned much of
   this variability, generating 10–14 ‘tick marks’ along the latent trait
   where measurement could occur (Fig. 4). Taken together, the Thurstonian
   thresholds for all items within each scale were generally well-spaced
   at the higher end of the trait (i.e., at intermediate and high levels
   of the perception of conflict with evolution), producing only small
   gaps in measurement (see thresholds 2–4). However, the thresholds at
   the lower end of the trait (i.e., at low levels of perceived conflict
   with evolution) had larger gaps among them, likely resulting in less
   precise measurement (see thresholds 1–2). Although the precision with
   which respondents could be clustered into bins at the lower end of the
   trait might be relatively low as compared to the higher end of the
   trait, the reliability of the clustering was very high. Specifically,
   both item and person reliabilities were strong (EAP = 0.867–0.903; WLE
   = 0.867–0.915), suggesting that items and persons at all levels of the
   trait could be meaningfully and consistently ordered on a linear scale.
   Likewise, the rating scale displayed a strong correspondence between
   participants’ answer choices for each item (Fig. 5b, e, h) and their
   overall latent person measures, and showed no evidence of disordered
   thresholds (Fig. 5c, f, i). Collectively, these findings suggest
   acceptable reliability and precision of measurement for the SECM.

   Rating scale functioning for the SECM

   We found no evidence of DIF across time for any scale of
   evolutionary conflict in the SECM (t-ratio <lt; 2 for all interactions
   between items and time), suggesting measurement invariance for time in
   our sample. Therefore, the SECM appeared to measure the same construct
   pre- and post-course, making pre-post comparisons of the magnitude of
   the latent trait appropriate.

RQ2: Are respondents interpreting items as we anticipated?

   Approximately 92% (562/619) of respondents indicated that the proposed
   ‘community’ categories captured the top three most important aspects of
   their communities. The remaining 8% (57/619) of respondents selected
   “not applicable” for one of their answer options. It is possible that
   aspects of their community were missing from the options provided or
   that two categories sufficiently described the entirety of their
   communities. Regardless, the vast majority of respondents defined their
   communities using the categories we defined a priori. Furthermore,
   although there were some differences among respondents in the specific
   choices they made, 88% (547/619) of respondents chose friends (from
   high school or college) as one of the top three most important parts of
   their community, and this pattern did not differ by their personal
   conflict level group (X^2 = 3.9348, p = 0.047, 95% CI [-0.12, 0.004]).
   Therefore, in addition to defining their communities as we intended,
   most respondents also defined their communities similarly to each
   other, and this definition did not differ significantly based on
   conflict level.

RQ3: Are latent SECM measures convergent with measures of similar constructs?

   There was a significant positive correlation between the latent
   measures of each respondent’s perception of their family’s conflict
   with evolution ideas (i.e., SECM Family item set) and the modified
   Inclusion of Others in Self [IOS] item (Spearman correlation: r = 0.50,
   p <lt; 0.001).

RQ4: Do measures of conflict derived from the SECM contribute to the
explanation of evolution acceptance above and beyond the contributions of
religiosity and evolution knowledge?

   We used SEM (specifically LVPM) to evaluate the hypothesized causal
   relationships among the SECM scales, and between the SECM and evolution
   acceptance (Fig. 6). Our measurement model had acceptable fit to the
   data (see Table ​Table3)3) and no posteriori changes to the model were
   made. Given the acceptable fit of the measurement model to our sample
   data, we had license to estimate the structural model. The structural
   model also had acceptable fit to the sample data (see Table
   ​Table3).3). See Additional file 1: Table S2 for summary statistics of
   factor loadings, Additional file 2: Table S3 for the raw variance
   covariance matrix, and Additional file 3: Table S4 for the means and
   standard deviations of raw scores.

   evolution acceptance) (represented here by a box with arrows emerging
   from it), which effectively controlled for the effects of these
   variables on all path coefficients. Assuming a correct underlying
   model, the path coefficients shown in the model reflect the magnitude
   of the causal impact of these variables, holding all other variables
   constant (including evolution knowledge, religiosity, and background
   variables). The disturbances for each factor are represented by a
   circled D. Significance levels: * <lt; 0.05; ** <lt; 0.01; *** <lt; 0.001

   Assuming a correct underlying model, the perceptions of family and
   community positively impacted perceptions of personal conflict with
   evolution, which subsequently negatively impacted evolution acceptance.
   Specifically, controlling for all other modeled variables (including
   background variables, religiosity and evolution knowledge), a one
   standard deviation increase in perceptions of family conflict and
   community conflict caused, on average, a 0.54 and 0.15 standard
   deviation increase in personal conflict, respectively (Fig. 6, Table
   ​Table4).4). Subsequently, a one standard deviation increase in
   personal conflict caused a 0.47–0.59 standard deviation decrease in
   acceptance (Fig. 6, Table ​Table4).4). Therefore, personal conflict had
   a moderately-sized causal impact on all scales of acceptance that was
   above and beyond the contributions of evolution knowledge and
   religiosity.

Discussion

   The purpose of this study was to advance empirical and conceptual work
   in evolution education by developing an instrument capable of
   productively measuring perceptions of conflict with evolution (SECM).
   Below we discuss findings regarding validity evidence and instrument
   functioning and the potential of the SECM to clarify the factors
   impacting evolution acceptance. Table ​Table55 summarizes the findings
   according to validity evidence category.

Validity evidence and instrument functioning

   Multiple scales and variables relating to the perception of conflict
   with evolution have been proposed in the literature over the past
   several decades. The development of the SECM involved content domain
   delineation, construct conceptualization, and operationalization as a
   measurement tool. An expert panel verified that the structure and items
   of the SECM appropriately and completely represented the targeted
   content domain. The potential of the SECM to generate robust measures
   of the intended construct was examined using six criteria: item fit,
   reliability, dimensionality, rating scale functioning, person-item
   alignment, and measurement invariance. The SECM achieved acceptable
   results for all of these criteria. Specifically, the instrument was
   found to operate most effectively as three distinct dimensions with
   items grouped by social scale (i.e., personal, family, community) and
   not by the variable (i.e., values, culture, beliefs). This finding
   emerged from the PCA of Rasch residuals, and was further supported by a
   likelihood ratio test of this three-dimensional structure. Overall,
   these findings suggest that each scale of conflict operates as a
   distinct dimension, and the broader social context associated with
   conflict perception was not adequately captured by one subscale alone.

   We also found that the conflict items (i.e., values, culture, and
   beliefs) within each scale adequately fit the Rasch model and
   productively measured the construct. The SECM also had high reliability
   values and a well-functioning rating scale, indicating that the items
   (by their agreeability) and the persons (by their latent ability) could
   be consistently and meaningfully ordered on a linear scale, allowing
   these measures to be analyzed using parametric statistical applications
   (Boone et al. 2014). The items were also generally well-matched to the
   target population (i.e., university undergraduates in an introductory
   biology course) and respondents with intermediate to high measures on
   the latent trait had a high precision of measurement. Respondents with
   low measures on the latent trait had relatively lower measurement
   precision, suggesting that an easier item (i.e., one that students with
   relatively low latent levels of conflict would endorse) might be a
   valuable addition to the instrument to increase precision at this
   portion of the rating scale. However, because precise measurement of
   the trait where conflict levels are intermediate to high is likely to
   be more important to researchers than precise measurement where levels
   are low, we do not consider this finding to be a significant weakness
   of the SECM.

   The items were also found to be measurement invariant across time,
   suggesting that respondents interpreted items similarly before and
   after evolution instruction. Therefore, the SECM could be used to make
   meaningful inferences about changes in perceptions of conflict with
   evolution in response to instruction or targeted interventions. Several
   researchers have proposed frameworks for guiding the development of
   interventions that target the compatibility of evolution and religion
   (e.g., Barnes and Brownell 2017) and the bounded nature of science
   (e.g., Nelson et al. 2019). Results from researchers who have
   implemented curricular interventions aimed at reducing conflict
   (particularly between religion and evolution) suggest that it is a
   malleable trait that can be successfully impacted by instruction (e.g.,
   Barnes and Brownell 2017; Nehm and Schonfeld 2007; Truong et al. 2018).

   Measures from the family subscale of the SECM correlated significantly
   and modestly with the Inclusion of Others in Self (IOS) instrument,
   which measured the perception of compatibility between family and
   evolutionary ideas. This modest correlation provides convergent
   validity evidence for the SECM, but also suggests that the perception
   of conflict (or incompatibility) (targeted by the SECM) and the
   perception of compatibility (targeted by the IOS) are not necessarily
   direct opposites of one another from a measurement perspective. More
   work on the perception of compatibility (or harmony) with evolution
   could offer different inferences and is clearly warranted.

   Finally, the follow-up question asking respondents to share the top
   three most important parts of their communities indicated that they
   defined their communities as intended. Furthermore, most respondents
   defined their communities similarly to each other (regardless of their
   level of conflict), with friends as one of the most important
   components of community. Additional substantive validity evidence would
   be valuable for other aspects of the SECM.

Using the SECM to advance evolution education research

   In order to illustrate how the SECM could advance understanding of the
   complex web of variables connected to evolution acceptance, SEM was
   used to evaluate hypothesized causal relationships among the SECM
   scales, and between the SECM and evolution acceptance. Several other
   variables shown to be important in the literature (e.g., knowledge,
   religiosity) were also collected to examine if and how the SECM
   enhances explanatory insights. Two major findings emerged: (i) family
   and community conflict both had unique causal contributions to personal
   conflict, with family showing a stronger and modest impact, and (ii)
   personal conflict had a significant and modest causal impact on all
   scales of evolution acceptance above and beyond the contributions of
   religiosity, evolution knowledge, and background variables. We discuss
   the implications of each of these findings below.

   It is notable that both family and community conflict had unique casual
   impacts on personal perceptions of conflict with evolution. Few studies
   have directly compared the strength of the association of community and
   family on personal conflict. Studies that have collected data at both
   scales have similarly found that family contributions were more
   apparent than community contributions (e.g., Winslow et al. 2011). Such
   studies have the potential to provide insights into possible targets
   for intervention development. However, no studies to our knowledge have
   addressed this relationship in a latent modeling framework, which
   allows for more precise and accurate measures of each latent trait and
   the nature of the relationships among them. The SECM is well suited for
   use in such frameworks. The specific causal structure modeled among the
   SECM scales in this paper was based on our interpretation of the
   literature (see above). While the acceptable data-model fit we report
   suggests that this structure is a tenable explanation for the
   associations in the data, it is important to emphasize that
   alternative, mathematically equivalent models that would explain the
   data equally well may exist (Mueller and Hancock 2008). Therefore,
   researchers are not limited to modeling the subscales or the items of
   the SECM in the manner highlighted in this paper, nor are they
   obligated to use all three subscales simultaneously. The validity
   evidence presented in this paper was generated for each scale
   individually so use of select scales is acceptable. Furthermore, the
   Rasch-based evidence for internal structure validity made no
   distinction between reflective (i.e., the items are manifestations or
   indicators of the latent trait) and formative models (i.e., the items
   cause the latent trait), and researchers may consider alternative
   relationships between each latent trait and its associated items that
   best suits their conceptual framework. Overall, alternate theory-driven
   formulations of the relationships among the scales and the items is
   encouraged.

   As a focus of future study, it is worth considering whether the
   strength of the causal links among the SECM scales might differ between
   members of different identity groups. For example, preliminary evidence
   suggests that the relative impact of family vs. community on personal
   perspectives may differ across racial groups. Mead et al. (2015) report
   that the science-related career interests of African American and
   Latino/a university students were more strongly influenced by people
   that identify as being members of the same racial/ethnic group, whereas
   European Americans were more strongly influenced by their parents or
   guardians. Furthermore, Dewsbury et al. (2019) reports that Latino
   American university students described both the importance of familial
   ties, and the sociocultural expectations related to their identities,
   as key roles in determining their perspectives on STEM-related career
   choice. Therefore, taken together, these studies suggest that
   perceptions of community conflict with evolution may be an important
   contributor to the personal conflict perception of URMs. Furthermore,
   if the experience of conflict within the classroom is generally agreed
   to be a problematic feature of the learning environment–and evidence
   suggests it should be (e.g., Azmitia et al. 2008; Chemers et al. 2011;
   Goodenow 1993; Goodenow and Grady 1993; Griffith and Brem 2004)–then
   the differential contributors to personal conflict should be an
   important target for study and intervention. Reducing perceived
   conflict with evolution may therefore be an important goal that extends
   beyond its relationship with evolution acceptance. This is an avenue of
   research that has not to our knowledge been explored empirically.

   Experiencing conflict with a core concept of biology may also be linked
   to the physical and emotional well-being of students, and as such,
   might impact psychosocial and performance outcomes. For example,
   perceptions of conflict may reduce students’ sense of belonging and
   science identity compatibility in science classrooms. Sense of
   belonging and identity compatibility can be powerful motivators for
   academic commitment and achievement (Chemers et al. 2011; Goodenow
   1993; Goodenow and Grady 1993). Indeed, feelings of isolation have been
   shown to be greater for URMs in STEM (Cohen and Garcia 2008) and linked
   to (i) doubts about their ability to succeed and (ii) stereotype
   threat activation. Students with religious backgrounds also report
   feelings of alienation in biology classrooms (Barnes et al. 2017c).
   These feelings of exclusion can emerge from students’ multiple, and
   sometimes competing, identities. Experiencing conflict with aspects of
   one’s identity, as well as developing new identities that might not
   appear to be compatible with existing ones may be stressful (Azmitia et
   al. 2008; Griffith and Brem 2004), which may in turn have negative
   impacts on memory processing and learning (Vogel and Schwabe 2016). For
   these reasons, conflict may negatively impact students’ well-being and
   academic performance. We therefore join other authors (e.g., Mead et
   al. 2015) in advocating for the disaggregation of data in evolution
   education by key identity variables (such as race) that could
   contribute to feelings of conflict and exclusion.

   We also report that personal conflict had a significant and modest
   causal impact on all scales of evolution acceptance above and beyond
   the contributions of religiosity, evolution knowledge, and background
   variables. Human evolution acceptance showed the largest impact of
   personal conflict, which indicated that while the perception of
   conflict with evolution was important for all scales of evolution
   acceptance, it may be most important for the acceptance of human
   evolution. These results suggest that the perception of conflict with
   evolution may in fact impact evolution acceptance in a manner that is
   not accounted for by other available variables. These results do not
   suggest that all theoretically important variables have been accounted
   for by this model. For example, religious denominational differences
   could be an important contributor to perceptions of conflict.^2 As a
   next step, researchers could consider incorporating the SECM into more
   complicated SEM models that treat evolution knowledge and religiosity
   (as well as other theoretically important variables, such as religious
   denomination [see Jensen et al. 2019^3]) as part of the structural
   pathways leading to and emerging from acceptance. Such a model would
   allow for the direct comparison of the strength of the causal
   relationships of each variable with acceptance, and provide valuable
   insights into the most worthwhile targets for the development of
   interventions. Therefore, the SECM allows for the testing of hypotheses
   about the causes of conflict, which extend far beyond what we have
   presented in this study.

Limitations

   The SECM is a first (and admittedly incomplete) step towards more
   completely operationalizing and measuring conflict with evolution;
   different conceptual frameworks and measurement approaches than we have
   used may be equally valuable. Although our psychometric work was fairly
   comprehensive, validity comprises many categories that were not
   investigated in our study (AERA et al. 2014). Indeed, the process of
   instrument validation involves an iterative (and often gradual)
   accumulation of multiple forms of evidence that collectively support
   the interpretations of instrument measures for their proposed uses. Our
   study used the framework of construct validity (Campbell and Nehm 2013;
   Messick 1995). In line with this framework, we generated four forms of
   validity evidence: content validity, internal structure validity,
   convergent validity, and substantive validity. While these forms of
   validity evidence have so far supported the theoretical underpinnings
   of the SECM and the quality of the inferences that it generates, the
   instrument would benefit from additional evidence for these and other
   uninvestigated forms. In particular, convergent evidence was presented
   for only one of the three subscales of the SECM (i.e., family
   conflict). The other two subscales are in need of this form of evidence
   as well. Moreover, evidence based on response processes (i.e.,
   substantive validity) have only been studied for the community scale,
   and validity generalization (i.e., generalization validity) and
   evidence of consequences have not been studied. Evidence based on
   response processes addresses the cognitive processes involved in
   answering questions (AERA et al. 2014). “Think-aloud” interviews may be
   used for this purpose in order to evaluate if respondent
   interpretations match intended item meanings for other items and
   scales. This form of validity evidence can help answer questions about
   the different interpretations respondents from different identity
   groups could have. Evidence based on validity generalization deals with
   the extent to which validity evidence generated in one setting can be
   generalized to new settings (AERA et al. 2014). At present, the SECM
   has been administered and evaluated at one type of institution.
   Therefore, validity studies on the SECM in different geographic,
   institutional, and demographic settings are needed. Without evidence of
   generalizability, this instrument should not yet be interpreted in
   other settings without researchers producing local validity evidence
   (AERA et al. 2014). Evidence based on consequences deals with the
   extent to which the outcomes or benefits proposed by the test are
   realized (AERA et al. 2014). For example, if decreasing the perception
   of conflict with evolution decreases anxiety, increases feelings of
   belonging in the classroom, and increases evolution acceptance, then
   reducing conflict through targeted interventions should display these
   outcomes. Furthermore, if low evolution acceptance and the perception
   of conflict with evolution are barriers for students persisting in
   biology majors and seeking evolution-related careers, level of conflict
   should be a significant indirect or direct predictor of these outcomes.
   Clearly, this study is one very small step towards advancing work on
   measuring conflict with evolution.

Conclusion

   This paper introduced the SECM, an easy-to-administer instrument
   designed to measure perceptions of conflict with evolution at multiple
   scales. The SECM embodies three attributes discussed in the literature:
   (i) it addresses the hierarchical nature of human social structures
   (conceptualized as personal, family, and community), (ii) probes
   conflict as it relates to human values, cultures, and beliefs, (iii)
   allows conflict to encompass diverse sources (not only religion). Four
   forms of validity evidence–content, internal structure, convergent, and
   substantive–supported the meaning of the inferences drawn from SECM
   measures. The instrument was found to be representative of the intended
   construct, capable of producing reliable and precise measures, and
   aligned with measures of a similar construct. The SECM was designed to
   be used flexibly so that researchers may apply it in a manner that best
   aligns with their hypotheses and analytical frameworks. Specifically,
   the subscales may be implemented separately or together, and used in
   several theory-driven orientations. Generating robust measures of the
   perception of conflict with evolution using the SECM has the potential
   for advancing understanding of the factors accounting for evolution
   acceptance, and for informing practices and outcomes relating to
   evolution education.

Footnotes

   ^1Walker et al. introduced multiple new measures in place of existing,
   more robustly validated measures without explanation. Psychometric and
   methodological limitations of the study suggest caution is needed when
   interpreting the findings.

   ^2We thank an anonymous reviewer for this suggestion.

   ^3The findings of Jensen et al. 2019 should be interpreted with caution
   because they (i) introduced multiple new measures in place of existing,
   more robustly validated measures without explanation. (ii) performed
   exploratory and causal modeling on the same data set, (iii) interpreted
   the SEM model despite unacceptable model fit. Psychometric and
   methodological limitations of the study suggest caution is needed when
   interpreting the findings.

Abstract

   The idea of biological evolution is not accepted by many people around
   the world, with a large disparity amongst countries. Some factors may
   act as obstacles to the acceptance of evolution, such as religion, a
   lack of openness to experience, and not understanding the nature of
   science. Although the strength of the association between evolution
   acceptance and non-scientific factors varies among studies, it is often
   assumed that resistance to evolution is the byproduct of a religious
   background. Some studies are even more specific and try to associate
   the acceptance of evolution with precise religious affiliations. We
   aimed to explore the strength of associations among nationality,
   religion, and the acceptance of evolution by students using multiple
   correspondence analysis (MCA) and statistical tools, with nationwide
   samples from two different countries. Here, we show that wider
   sociocultural factors predict the acceptance of evolution to a higher
   degree than a religious background. We carried out two nationwide data
   collections that allowed us to compare differences in the acceptance of
   evolution in Italy and Brazil by high school students who declare to
   belong to the same religion in the two countries. Roman Catholic
   students showed significant differences between the two countries, and
   the gap between them was wider than between Catholics and non-Catholic
   Christians within Brazil. Our conclusions support those who argue that
   religious affiliation is not the main factor in predicting the level of
   evolution acceptance. The sociocultural environment and the level of
   evolutionary knowledge seem to be more important in this regard. These
   results open up new interpretative perspectives and provide a better
   understanding of attitudes towards evolution.

Introduction

   The acceptance of evolution has been a central topic in evolution
   education in at least the last three decades [1,2]. Researchers have
   examined numerous factors that may act as obstacles to the acceptance
   of evolution, such as religiosity, knowledge of evolutionary theory,
   the understanding of the nature of science, scientific aptitudes, and
   psychological conflicts, among others [3–6]. A major association seems
   to exist among three main factors: the understanding of key biological
   concepts, religious factors, and the understanding of the nature of
   science. However, the data require further investigation.

   A systematic literature review of the current state of research
   regarding students’ and teachers’ acceptance of evolution across Europe
   found that the level of acceptance of evolution in different
   educational settings is ambiguous. The authors argue that similar
   samples and a standardized assessment of the acceptance of evolution
   are necessary for cross-country comparisons [7].

   The use of different instruments to measure evolution acceptance could
   be a cause of conflicting research results. A variety of tests have
   been proposed, including the Measure of Acceptance of the Theory of
   evolution (MATE), which has been widely used for more than 20 years and
   recently revised [8], the Inventory of Student evolution Acceptance
   (I-SEA) [9], the Generalized Acceptance of evolution Evaluation (GAENE)
   [10], etc. It should be considered that the studies cited above differ
   in their contexts of comparison in relation to ages, countries, and
   socioeconomic levels, as well as the number of data collected and
   measurement statistics. However, inconsistencies in the results were
   found even in the analysis of the same group with different instruments
   measuring the acceptance of evolution.

   Barnes et al. [6] conducted separate analyses using six different
   evolution acceptance instruments with the same group of students, a
   large sample of around 2,300 university students. The instruments were
   administered in a random order to avoid bias due to differential
   attention and response readiness. The results were surprising and
   showed that different instruments led to different results for the
   measure of evolution acceptance, including conflicting ones. These
   results may also be interpreted as an indication that some instruments
   need methodological revisions in the search for possible distortions
   and biases.

   Additionally, the research findings revealed a complex relationship
   between understanding evolutionary concepts (e.g. natural selection)
   and evolution acceptance [10–13]. The same lack of consensus exists
   when measuring the level of evolution knowledge, given that several
   alternative assessment tools are available and may lead to different
   results [14,15]. A study with secondary school students (aged 14–16) in
   the United Kingdom found that teaching genetics before teaching
   evolution had a significant impact on improving evolution understanding
   but did not result in a significantly increased acceptance of evolution
   [16]. This reflects a weak correlation between the knowledge and
   acceptance of evolution, which also appears to be present in
   undergraduate students. In Chilean students of 15–16 years old, it was
   found that including instruction on the nature of science in the class
   on evolution improved their acceptance significantly [17].

   Kuschmierz et al. [7] identified 56 papers from the period of 2010–2020
   regarding students’ and teachers’ knowledge and acceptance of evolution
   across 29 European countries. However, according to the authors, the
   research findings were hard to compare due to the application of
   different instruments and the assessment of different key concepts. The
   available database was not sufficient to obtain reasonably comparable
   data from European countries. In addition, the ambiguous results of the
   research demonstrate multiple challenges regarding measurement of
   evolution education, such as (a) inadequate definitions of key
   constructs (attitudes, acceptance, knowledge, and understanding are
   often not defined or inconsistently used in publications); (b) the
   application of diverse measurement instruments (different evolution
   acceptance instruments may produce different results, even when applied
   to the same population); (c) the multidimensionality of knowledge about
   evolution (most instruments focus on single evolutionary constructs,
   such as natural selection and related concepts).

   The authors [18] then developed an instrument to measure attitudes and
   understanding across Europe and beyond, called the “evolution Education
   Questionnaire on Acceptance and Knowledge” (EEQ). The measurement
   instrument was translated into several European languages, in the
   various Romance, Germanic, and Slavic branches, and was recently
   applied to 9200 first-year university students in 26 European countries
   [19].

   This is a recent initiative, and thus, due to a lack of standardized
   assessment procedures in the existing literature, previous results
   should be used with caution when trying to compare countries, as there
   are several limitations, such as sampling biases, etc. [18].

   Religious beliefs are among the factors most investigated as predictors
   to the low acceptance of evolution in several studies, especially among
   some age groups, religious affiliations, and nationalities, mainly
   Christian American students [10,20,21]. Barnes et al. [22] conducted a
   study with 1898 students in eight states of the United States and found
   that 56.5% of students perceived that evolution is atheistic, with a
   higher percentage of Catholic and other Christian students. This
   perception among students may lead to an apparent conflict between
   their personal religious beliefs and evolution [23].

   In addition to Christians, those of the Muslim faith have been
   investigated, although the debate between several religions and
   evolution is more typically addressed in Western contexts [24].
   However, multifactorial models have found that once religiosity and
   other measures are accounted for, the amount of variance in acceptance
   of evolution is greatly reduced [13,25]. Mantelas and Mavrikaki [26]
   examined the acceptance of evolution and its relationship with
   religiosity among Greek university biology students. A rather weak
   correlation was found between the two factors.

   evolution is controversial among both religious and non-religious
   individuals, and inconsistent views of evolution have been evidenced in
   both groups [24,27]. The picture appears to not be static, as a sample
   of U.S. education professionals with a wide range of religious
   commitments showed a significantly higher level of acceptance than
   previous studies [28]. Moreover, the level of public acceptance of
   evolution has increased in the United States in the last decade, and
   education seems to play a significant role [29]. Thus, in certain
   social contexts, religiosity may be a main component by itself, while
   in others, evolution acceptance may depend on other factors.

   There is a tendency, which cannot be taken as unanimous, that
   associates the belief in any God (deism) as intrinsically
   anti-evolutionist [30]. One can easily remember the several references
   to the "Creator" in the Origin of Species, especially in its second
   edition, showing that this direct link is far more complex than it may
   seem at a first sight. The high heterogeneity of data available and the
   well-known methodological issues around gathering sensitive opinions
   and beliefs do not allow for a narrow focus on the search for one
   isolated variable. However, it has been often assumed that resistance
   to evolution is somehow a byproduct of religious background, especially
   in the United States [22,31].

   Some researchers have focused closely on specific religious groups,
   such as Pentecostal Christians, known for their literal reading of
   sacred texts and strong opposition to evolution [32]. One study was
   carried out in Brazil, where these religious groups have a growing
   influence, and tried to establish a direct correlation between the
   frequency of Pentecostal Christians and the level of rejection of
   evolution between the students of two high schools [33]. A written
   instrument was created, based on a well-known one [8], and 10 students
   were invited for semi-structured interviews [33]. Although no direct
   correlation was found, the author concluded that religious beliefs are
   important elements that shape students’ ideas, possibly introducing
   “constraints that might hinder the understanding of evolutionary
   theory” [33, p. 63].

   Another piece of research developed a survey instrument with a
   nationwide sample of the British population about the general public’s
   views of evolution. As the study had a closer focus on religion, there
   was oversampling of five different religious affiliations: Anglicans
   (or Episcopalians), Catholics, Muslims, Pentecostal Christians, and
   Independent Evangelical Christians. The results showed a strong
   rejection of evolution by Muslims, Pentecostals, and Independent
   Evangelical Christians, contrary to the position of non-religious
   people, Anglicans, and Catholics, who showed high agreement to
   statements about human evolution. The study revealed that the frequency
   of religious service attendance is a large significant predictor of
   evolution rejection among most religious groups [24, p.88]. The general
   conclusion was that religious affiliation and the degree to which
   individuals participate in religious practices affect the acceptance of
   evolution as a valid theory.

   A recent study with a large sample of almost 8000 undergraduate biology
   students in different states of the United States searched for
   correlations between religious affiliation and variables such as the
   acceptance and understanding of evolution. Using a Likert scale
   instrument, they found that Muslim undergraduate students showed
   slightly higher evolution acceptance levels than Protestant students,
   but significantly lower levels than Catholic, Jewish, Buddhist, and
   Hindu students [34].

   However, some researchers have been questioning the common view that
   religious affiliation is the main factor to the acceptance of
   evolution. They argue that it is more likely that people form beliefs
   congruent with their broad cultural identity, which includes but is not
   limited to religious belief [35,36]. However, most articles arguing in
   this direction are case studies and philosophical or legal debates
   about evolution vs creation in the school curricula, mostly in the U.S.
   context [37]. In addition, with few exceptions, such as the reports by
   Miller et al. [2] and Clément [36], most studies have focused on a
   specific culture or country, even if with large samples.

   Our main research question tried to address this complex picture
   considering the same religious affiliation in two different countries
   with deep sociocultural differences. Catholic Christians in Italy and
   Brazil have several similarities, including many family connections
   owing to immigration history. Brazil is the country with the highest
   number of Catholic Christians in the world, and Italy is the hub of
   Roman Catholicism. They follow the same basic regulations from the
   Vatican, which include explicit views on biological evolution and a
   non-literal interpretation of sacred texts. However, there are deep
   sociocultural differences due to many complex factors, including
   education. A survey comprising 192 Brazilian students was carried out
   in Brazil in 1990, which found a great deal of Lamarckian views [38].
   One should also consider that in the last three decades, there has been
   a significant rise in the creationist movement in Brazil [39]. One
   Brazilian state minister declared in 2019 that the Evangelical Church
   should fight against the introduction of the theory of evolution in
   public schools, before her recent nomination [40]. Another member of
   the federal government declared in an open ceremony that Intelligent
   Design (ID) should be introduced in Brazil’s public schools as “a
   counterpoint to the theory of evolution”, assuming that there would be
   a “creationist theory” to be taught in science lessons starting at the
   primary level [41]. Research carried out in Brazil had already showed
   that creationism had a significant influence on young science teachers
   [42].

   Italy is a highly industrialized country within the European Union.
   Research on the public understanding of science has been frequent, with
   nationwide surveys since 2004 [43]. However, specific research on the
   knowledge and acceptance of evolution in Italy was scarce at that time.
   Whereas Italy is included in broader international surveys, it accounts
   only for a few targeted case studies that vary in types of audience and
   goals. Despite the scarce data, researchers indicated that rejection of
   the evolutionary theory is neither widespread nor deeply rooted in
   Italian society [44], which was confirmed by Pew Research Center
   reports. The same source recently confirmed the tendency of the rise of
   the creationist perspective in Brazil within adults, with a
   considerably lower acceptance of evolution by Christians in Brazil
   (51%) than in Italy (74%) [45].

Methodological issues

   Despite the similarities between Italy and Brazil, there is a marked
   difference between the two sociocultural contexts. However, some
   methodological issues should be properly addressed to avoid some
   sources of significant bias in the statistical tools to be used. The
   sample design was an important step, as nationwide samples best
   represent the complexity of the several sociocultural influences. As we
   were targeting the main religious group in both countries (Catholics),
   no oversampling was necessary. Non-Catholic Christians would be part of
   the sample, but no specific conclusions could be drawn considering the
   different religious affiliations within the group.

   Brazil is a country where religious practices are diverse and encompass
   several different belief systems and traditions, which reflect elements
   of European (Catholic and Protestant), African, Oriental, and
   indigenous religions, among others. This diversity has its foundation
   in the colonization process of European immigrants from 1500 onwards,
   African descendants, and local indigenous tribes [46].

   The group of non-Catholic Christians is very heterogeneous, and our
   database aggregated several different affiliations in the two
   countries: Orthodox, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Baptist, Adventist,
   Jehovah’s Witnesses, Assembly of God, Christian Congregation of Brazil,
   International of God’s Grace, World of God’s Power, and the Universal
   Church of the Kingdom of God. Therefore, we consider that the
   comparison between Catholics in the two countries was more suitable for
   this study, as it is a more homogeneous group. The term “evangelical”
   represents the universe of non-Catholic Christians considered by
   Brazilian society as “Brazilian Protestantism”, which is constituted by
   historical Protestants, Pentecostals, and Neo-Pentecostals and led by
   Pentecostals, with a massive dissemination by Neo-Pentecostals. Brazil
   is considered the country with the largest number of Roman Catholics in
   the world. However, this hegemony has been decreasing in recent
   decades, which reveals a changing trend in the religious composition of
   the population [47]. Data from the population census in Brazil point to
   the decline of the Roman Catholic religion and a continuous rise of
   protestant groups in the last decades [48].

   The age level was an essential component for sampling, as elderly
   people tend to be more conservative than young students. Taking
   advantage of an international project focusing on youngsters who were
   beginning high school level in both countries, we prepared separate
   sets of questions about evolution so that we had the very same
   questions answered by students of the same age in the same time frame,
   during the first months of the year 2014. Targeting students at the
   same age level in two different countries allows for closer comparisons
   than multi-age-wide groups. In the next section, a more detailed
   description of the sampling procedures in both countries is given.

   There is an important distinction that we must keep in mind when
   comparing the concepts of belief and acceptance. Differences between
   them have long been discussed in the philosophical literature and the
   specific field of evolution education [25,27,43,49]. The overall
   picture takes belief as a subjective disposition to consider p. simply
   as a premise under the influence of the wide cultural context. A
   well-known distinction is recognized between belief and conjecture
   since the latter is not committed to sensible things and applies even
   to the world of shadows. In this context, it is important to separate
   the notions of belief of classical philosophers, such as Plato and
   Aristotle, from the revision carried out by Thomas Aquinas, who
   considers belief in terms of "thinking with assent" related to faith
   [49]. In our theoretical framework, belief refers to the sensible world
   only, with the reality of things that exist. However, one can take p.
   as a belief, but it does not in itself imply an admission of the
   objective validity of the notion under consideration. Meanwhile, to
   accept p. implies not only recognizing the existence of some objective
   reality but also a further step in terms of judgment, admitting p. as
   valid under some specific circumstances; in short: “acceptance implies
   a commitment to a policy of premising that p.” [50].

   The instrument used in the recent work by Kuschmierz et al. [19],
   ATEVO, relies on eight items with statements about evolution, and
   students show their degree of agreement with each of them [51]. In the
   German context, the acceptance of evolution is defined as a “positive
   attitude” (“positive Einstellung”) towards evolution. In this regard,
   “attitude” (“Einstellung”) is defined as the level of association
   between a term or fact and its subjective evaluation, in terms of
   strength (“Starke”) and/or ability to bind with other terms or ideas
   (“Valenz”). On the opposite side, a “negative attitude” (“negative
   Einstellung”) is seen as “rejection” (“Ablehnung”). However, the result
   of ATEVO test may be the result of very different processes. On the one
   hand, “it remains unknown whether a person answers negatively for most
   items about evolution because he/she has a ‘bad feeling’” (“schlechtes
   Gefühl”) about evolution, in the sense of a preexisting emotional
   refusal to think on the subject. On the other hand, the rejection may
   have been the result of a long reflection leading to a rational
   conclusion that evolution is not plausible [51, p. 12].

   We adopted a clear definition of evolution acceptance despite the
   complexity of the discussion on the subject in different languages,
   taking acceptance as the expression of explicit recognition of the
   objective validity of known scientific statements about evolution under
   absolute anonymity. This definition considers two steps. The first is
   associated with scientific statements about evolution, which must be
   clear and well known, avoiding issues under discussion, for instance,
   about the origin of life. Students must show not only a positive
   attitude towards evolution but also express clearly that a statement
   based on biological evolution is considered a valid premise to
   construct a judgement about the real world.

   The second step refers to objective conditions in which a person may
   admit his/her positive judgment about a certain scientific statement.
   One may know a proposition but to refuse to show public recognition of
   it, or, on the contrary, manifest an opinion different from his/her
   deep feeling due to the suspicion that it may reach a wider audience.
   The perception of secrecy in everyday life is actually a major focus of
   concern worldwide. Strong evidence published in the literature shows
   that anonymity reduces social desirability distortion and increases
   self-disclosure [52,53].

   Therefore, anonymous participation must be guaranteed to every person
   who is responding to questions about religion-related subjects, such as
   biological evolution, especially when surveys are carried out within
   conservative social contexts. Under secrecy, a person may accept a
   proposition as a valid premise for argumentation, making inferences,
   deliberations, etc. as a mental, individual, and innermost act.
   However, this may not happen if there is a perception of the
   possibility of third parties identifying the individual opinion. This
   means, for instance, that phone calls or traceable connections using
   electronic devices such as smartphones could be perceived by
   respondents as possible ways of infringing the inviolability of the
   anonymous character of the individual manifestation.

   In our case, the students answered questions in their school
   environment and were told their answers would be under absolute
   anonymity. Previous analyses of this data bank showed surprisingly high
   mean scores of evolution acceptance within fundamentalist religious
   groups in Italy and Brazil [54]. This was also the case in a previous
   survey using a different methodology, carried out in 2010–11, where
   roughly half of Evangelical high school students in Brazil declared
   under absolute anonymity that their religion was not opposed to
   evolution [55].

   In line with the tantalizing results of the study by Barnes et al. [6]
   already mentioned, our research team proposed a revision to some
   methods adopted in the previous survey. As mentioned before, we were
   carrying out data collection as part of an international project
   focusing on students’ interests and attitudes on science and
   technology, which had started in 2007 [56]. The main research
   instrument was based on Likert scale items but allowed a separated
   section, which we added in both countries. However, we considered a
   different approach for these evolution items, as we were going to
   present students with factual statements that were regarded as right or
   wrong by scientists.

   Items following the Likert attitude data consist of favorable or
   unfavorable statements about an entity, admitting a spectrum of
   responses ranging from strong positive to strong negative answers, with
   a numerical scale from 1 to 5. The resulting data can be analyzed using
   several models that underlie latent variables. However, attitudes as
   well as response styles can affect the result. It is well known that
   numerical comparisons rely on the degree of precision of measures, for
   instance, to estimate the mean height of a group of people. The
   significance of the different statistical analyses are dependent on the
   precision of the instrument used in data collection. Likert scaling is
   used in instruments measuring attitudes, beliefs, and opinions about
   statements, allowing for an expression of moderation of opinion from
   agreement to disagreement. The key is to find ways of calibrating how
   strongly or mildly a statement should be worded. These scales are
   therefore suitable for issues related to open constructs and less
   suitable for scientific claims based on presumed factuality. An item
   likely to produce extreme responses, either full agreement or strong
   disagreement, would do a poor job of discriminating across the full
   spectrum of respondents [57]. Therefore, Likert scales may not be a
   good choice with statements expressing well-known scientific facts. In
   addition, in the case of theories of evolution, factuality is supported
   by the school context in which the questionnaires were filled out. The
   battery of items on evolution was proposed with dichotomous questions,
   given that each of them can have minimal variability.

   When evolution is considered, opinions can be expressed in terms of
   favorable and unfavorable subjective statements, such as “There is a
   significant body of data which supports evolutionary theory” [33],
   “There is strong, reliable evidence to support the theory of evolution”
   [24], or “I think there is reliable evidence to support the theory that
   describes how humans were derived from ancestral primates” [33]. In
   these three examples, latent variables can be inferred in terms of
   personal attitudes, which can range from weak to strong, and grading
   would help to correctly appraise the level of agreement. However,
   well-known factual scientific statements cannot be graded as weak or
   strong scientific facts. For instance “The age of the Earth is at least
   4 billion years” [33] or “I think that humans and apes share an ancient
   ancestor” [15], should be recognized as sound scientific statements (or
   not). We have here a black/white choice, and respondents would be able
   to express their judgment about these scientific statements as true or
   false (or declining to express their opinion). When a well-known
   scientific statement is marked as false, this means an explicit refusal
   to admit it as a valid premise to analyze a certain situation.

   One could argue that the level of admission or rejection can also be
   variable, but we cannot overlook the fact that respondents are aware
   they are invited to make a judgment different from simply recognizing
   the existence of an idea. In other words, respondents know what is
   expected from them. The scientific statement about the age of the
   planet is widely known, both from the scientific and the fundamentalist
   religious points of view. When ticking “false”, the respondents are
   confirming their rejection of a statement known to be accepted by a
   wide scientific community. A weak disagreement in a Likert scale should
   not be taken as equivalent as rejection, as one could say that there is
   some disagreement regarding the presented cipher, as a professional
   paleontologist probably would argue about the precise age of our
   planet. This disagreement cannot be taken as similar to the one from a
   Young Earth creationist, but in a Likert scale, both would have similar
   scores (1 and 2 out of 5 points in the Likert scale).

   Thus, in such cases, weak and strong disagreement may represent
   completely different attitudes, but with similar numerical values,
   undermining the measure’s precision. The option to change the
   instrument’s true/false options could enhance measurability, a critical
   aspect of survey sampling [58]. Thus, contrary to some of our previous
   pieces of research, we did not adopt Likert scale items in the
   questionnaire used in this study, which is presented below.

Materials and methods

Survey instrument

   We sought to measure evolution acceptance based on five clear
   statements related to the evolutionary theory: Earth age, the fossil
   record, common ancestry, and the origin of human beings. We included an
   item about understanding, related to deep time, as it has been
   considered a relevant barrier to evolution acceptance [59], while
   statements about human evolution are highly controversial even amongst
   biology teachers [60]. As mentioned before, the section of evolution
   provided scientific statements as a separated set of items as part of a
   longer questionnaire within the Relevance of Science Education (ROSE)
   project [see 56]. One seminar was held in Venice (Italy) and another in
   Brasília (Brazil) in the year 2012, bringing together researchers from
   both countries for the construction of the research instrument.
   Collaborative arrangements were defined for conducting joint data
   collection using the same instrument, whose final wording was defined
   after fieldwork and validation with students from two high schools in
   the following year and applied in early 2014 in both countries [54].

   Eight items related to evolution were offered to the students under a
   command line asking to simply tick each of the following statements as
   true or false, and a gentle refusal to answer the question (“I wouldn’t
   know how to put it”). The Italian expression (“non saprei dire”) was
   considered similar to the Portuguese translation adopted in Brazil
   (“não saberia dizer”). The statements are presented below, according to
   their identification in Section G of the questionnaire, which was then
   called the “SAPIENS Barometer” of the second round of the ROSE project
   in Italy and Brazil. The items read as follows:
     * G75—The formation of our planet occurred some 4.5 billion years
       ago;
     * G76—Fossils are evidence of living beings that lived in the past;
     * G77—Present-day species of animals and plants originated from other
       species of the past;
     * G78—evolution occurs in both plants and animals;
     * G79—Humans are descended from other primate species;
     * G80—The human species has inhabited planet Earth in the last
       100,000 years;
     * G81—Different organisms may have a common ancestor;
     * G83—The first humans were prey to carnivorous dinosaurs.

   As item G82 was inadvertently absent in the Italian questionnaire, it
   was not considered here for comparisons between Brazilians and
   Italians.

Sample design and research ethics

   Sample design is basically composed of two aspects: a selection
   process, defining the rules and operations leading to the definition of
   clear targets in a wide population, and the estimation process, leading
   to sample estimates of population values [58]. These two aspects were
   standardized in both countries since the two research teams were taking
   part in the same international project above mentioned [56]. This
   international project targeted students who were beginning high school
   level for several reasons; one of them is related to the fact that at
   this age level, moral development is already completed in most
   cultures, predicting long-term behavior [61]. The study was conducted
   using stratified sampling both in Italy and Brazil.

   The Brazilian sample was designed as a sub-sample of the 2009 OECD-PISA
   sample and considered characteristics such as the offering of high
   school levels, the administrative organization of the school (public or
   private), the location (rural or urban, including all capitals and
   cities in the interior of each state), and the Human Development Index
   (HDI) of the state. There were three explicit stratification variables
   (state, grade status, and certainty), with a total of 82 explicit
   strata, and three implicit stratification variables (origin of funding,
   urban/rural, and HDI level) [62]. The PISA sample comprised 976 schools
   from the 27 units of the Brazilian Federation, from which 120 schools
   were randomly drawn, with implicit stratification to allow all
   federation units to be part of the subsample. This total included 20
   schools for replacement.

   Parcels with paper questionnaires and instructions were sent by
   ordinary mail to 100 schools located in 87 different municipalities all
   around the country after phone/email contact with the schools’
   principals [63]. Differences from the PISA procedures were explained.
   They were to select one classroom from the first year of high school
   (“primeiro ano do Ensino Médio”) by a random drawing. A reasonable
   number of schools (n = 78) returned the paper questionnaires after a
   few weeks, with short reports describing how the process was carried
   out and a signed letter (see below). After reading the report, the
   questionnaires were scanned for machine-reading, leading to a digital
   database with answers for 96 items and personal and family details,
   such as age, gender, religious membership, and socioeconomic
   indicators. The number of students reached 2,404 from 72 municipalities
   of 26 federative units of the country (see Appendix 1 in Oliveira [63,
   p. 288–9]).

   The sampling was carried out by the EDEVO-Darwin Research Nucleus in
   the first half of 2014, following all the applicable ethical
   procedures. The contact with school principals included an explanation
   of how the school was selected, differences from OECD/PISA technical
   procedures, the voluntary nature of participation, students’ right to
   withdraw at any time with no penalties, and the maintenance of the
   confidentiality of school participation and guarantee of student
   anonymity. School principals demonstrated their accordance with the
   ethical procedures, sending back the parcel with the questionnaires to
   the postal address of the research nucleus by ordinary mail, together
   with a signed letter of informed consent (see Appendix A in Pinafo [64,
   p. 437–442]). The expected risks and benefits were explained, and
   mutual advantages were effectively achieved [65]. The database built by
   the EDEVO-Darwin Research Nucleus was already anonymized, and, in
   addition, the schools were recoded to prevent identification. Very
   similar procedures were adopted by Observa, the institution that
   constructed the Italian database in the same time-frame (see below).

   The Italian sample was designed following the stratification model,
   with random drawings from the universe of secondary schools (n =
   2,862), with two explicit stratification variables (geographical area,
   Grade 2 middle school status), with a total of 18 explicit strata, and
   two implicit stratification variables (school type, town type). The
   official list included high schools and enrolled students in Grade 2 of
   middle school (“secondo anno della Scuola Media di Secondo Grado”), in
   the year 2013/2014 [66], which corresponds to the same age level of the
   Brazilian sample.

   The sampling in Italy was proportional to the number of students in the
   grade that year in each one of the geographical areas in which the
   country is divided, as follows: North-West (25%), North-East (18%),
   Center (18%), South (27%), and Islands (12%). A random selection of 100
   schools followed the above-mentioned proportions. Instead of having the
   urban/rural school-type stratification, standard sampling procedures
   adopted in similar surveys in Italy recommend dividing the sample into
   two parts, drawing half of the schools from the group of regional major
   towns (“comuni capoluogo”), and the other half from all other
   municipalities (“territorio provinciale”) [67]. The questionnaires were
   sent to 103 schools after 14 replacements were randomly selected,
   having received materials in return from 99 schools from 88
   municipalities from all geographical areas of the country, comprising
   3503 students. Differently from what happened in Brazil, the procedures
   for database entry from the paper questionnaires were done manually,
   with no machine-reading.

   In Italy, the questionnaires were delivered to two classrooms for each
   selected school. The teachers explained to the students the objectives
   of the ROSE survey in each classroom by specifying how to fill it out
   and ensuring that the questionnaire was completely anonymous, along
   with all the other conditions in compliance with Italian legislation at
   the time (2014) [68]. Subsequently, after a brief introduction to the
   questionnaire, the students filled it out in paper or in the school
   computer lab, under teacher supervision, assuring they were working
   individually. Regulations for research on education in Italy are
   similar to the Brazilian ones and were followed, with no identification
   of the students or schools in the public databank, which was merged
   with the Brazilian one.

   The aggregated databank has been used for independent analyses,
   generating doctoral theses at different institutions and in several
   publications [46,63,64,69]. Using an anonymous database with public
   access, the authors did not submit the statistical analysis protocol to
   an Institutional Research Review Board in advance.

Data collection

   The survey took place between March and May 2014 in both countries.
   Paper-and-pencil questionnaires were used in both countries, as well as
   electronic forms in some schools in Italy, all under absolute
   anonymity. The instrument consisted of a section regarding personal
   data (gender, age, living place), some socioeconomic questions, 73
   Likert scale items, and the true/false section on evolution (G
   Section), which is the focus of the present study (see Annex A in
   Oliveira [63]).

   The students had roughly the same age level in both countries, being
   around 15 years old. Valid cases comprised only students from 14 to 16
   years old. There was a slight difference in the gender proportion in
   the two countries, as girls slightly outnumbered boys in Brazil (55%)
   and Italy (52%). The declaration of religion is a sensitive issue, and
   each country had a different presentation of the question. In Brazil,
   there was a direct question about religious affiliation (yes/no) and 18
   options for answers (Catholic/Orthodox/Evangelical denominations (10
   options), Jewish/ Buddhist/African denominations (2 options),
   Kardecist, and an “other” option). Some 12% of Brazilian students
   declared not to follow any religion. A high proportion of Brazilian
   religious students declared to be Catholic (56%); the largest
   non-Catholic Christian group was the Pentecostal Christians (21%),
   followed by Mission Evangelicals (10%), which were composed mainly of
   Baptists (6%) and Seventh-Day Adventists (2%). The number of Orthodox,
   Lutheran, and Anglican Christians was low, less than 1%. Other
   religions amounted to some 13% [63].

   In the Italian context, this section asked a general question about
   religion or transcendent philosophy. Two-thirds of the students
   declared to follow the Catholic religion (67%), and 22% declared not to
   follow any religion or transcendent philosophy. Of the respondents, 3%
   were non-Catholic Christians, and roughly the same were “other
   religions” (3.5%) [48]. Therefore, the total number of Catholics in our
   sample from the two countries was very high, reaching over 3,000 valid
   cases. The number of Brazilian non-Catholic Christians was reasonable,
   reaching 549 valid cases. However, they composed a very conservative
   group compared to, for instance, the group in Britain who responded to
   a survey about evolution [24], where the proportion of Anglicans and
   Lutherans was far higher than Pentecostal Christians and Independent
   Evangelical Christians, the two main groups in Brazil.

Statistical and numerical analyses

   All analyses were performed using the statistical software IBM SPSS
   Statistics 26. We used Chi-square statistics to determine if there were
   statistically significant differences between the answers from the two
   countries, different religious affiliations in the same country, and
   between Catholics of the two countries. Column proportion tests were
   also performed, testing whether, for each row, the proportion of
   respondents in one column was significantly different from the
   proportion in the other column. For each item, a global significance
   level of 5% was adopted. As we were working with multiple comparisons,
   the significance level for each individual test was adjusted according
   to the Bonferroni correction method [70] to maintain a global
   significance of 5%. Additional tables with general results can be found
   in the Supporting Information (S1 and S2 Tables). As the results show
   very significant differences, we tackled the problem of association
   among a set of variables using a multivariate method, multiple
   correspondence analysis (MCA) [71]. Another set of tables was provided,
   excluding the neutral option, and allowing for an exploratory graph
   (biplot) to be drawn with the true/false answers from seven items with
   significant values (G75, G76, G77, G79, G80, G81, and G83) from the
   samples of the two countries. The reasons to exclude G78, taking its
   results as outliers, are presented in the Supporting Information (S1
   File). For this analysis, the normalization method followed the main
   variable, using default procedures of IBM SPSS Statistics v.26. Each
   item was recorded according to the individuals’ nationality, religion,
   and option (true/false), generating eight labels:
     * 1 = BC + (Brazilian Catholic who answered “True”);
     * 2 = BC—(Brazilian Catholic who answered “False”);
     * 3 = BNC + (Brazilian non-Catholic Christian who answered “True”);
     * 4 = BNC—(Brazilian Christian non-Catholic who answered “False”);
     * 5 = IC + (Italian Catholic who answered “True”);
     * 6 = IC- (Italian Catholic who answered “False”);
     * 7 = INC + (non-Catholic Christian Italian who answered “True”);
     * 8 = INC- (Italian Christian non-Catholic who answered “False”).

   This led to a generalization showing four clear groups of students
   separated by both religion and nationality. The total number of
   students in the two countries who declared their religion was 3,944,
   but 63 had missing values in all seven items and were not considered;
   therefore, a total of 3,881 cases were processed. S3 Table in the
   Supporting Information shows the case-processing summary, S4 Table
   presents the numbers of every religious group in the two countries, and
   S5 Table shows the degree of association of each item with the two
   dimensions of the analysis. Supporting Information (S2 File) brings a
   detailed study of the MCA analysis (S6.1 to S6.10 Table in S2 File),
   leading to the conclusion that there is no evidence that the MCA
   results have any significant bias when comparing the responses of valid
   active cases with those with missing values. In the same file, a link
   provides access to the databank and the SPSS syntaxes.

   We then estimated the differences between the Christian denominations
   (Catholics and non-Catholics) within the same country (Brazil), such
   that BCat—BNCat = ΔBChr. In addition, we estimated differences within
   the same religion (Catholics) between countries (Brazil and Italy),
   such that ICat—BCat = ΔCat. Thereupon, we created an intercultural
   index (IntcI) to compare these differences, such that
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="normal">gt;I<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mi
   mathvariant="normal">gt;n<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="normal">gt;t<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mi

   If the intercultural index was higher than 1 (IntcI>gt;1), this meant that
   the Brazilian and Italian Catholics had more differences amongst
   themselves than among Brazilian Catholics and Brazilian non-Catholics
   Christians. This indicated that sociocultural factors played a more
   important role in the acceptance of evolution than religion itself. If
   the index was lower than 1 (IntcI<lt;1) this indicated the opposite, that
   religion played a major role.

Results

   Previous analyses of this sample already showed significant differences
   between Brazilian and Italian students [54,63]. It was clear that when
   human evolution was specifically the focus, the level of acceptance of
   evolution was lower in both countries. The same broad results were
   found in places where the context is particularly important for the
   historical development of the theory of evolution, such as the
   Galapagos Islands [72,73]. These analyses suggest that religion plays a
   considerable role in the level of support for evolution. S1 and S2
   Tables in the Supporting Information provide a wider view, showing that
   the Brazilian and Italian students have very significant differences
   (p<lt; 0.0005) regarding their answers to all items.

   Our main objective was to verify whether the answers in the same
   religious group (Catholics) were more similar in the two countries than
   among different denominations (Catholic and non-Catholic Christians)
   within the same country (Brazil). Thus, we compared students from the
   two countries who share the same religion. Table 1 presents the results
   for each item comparing Brazilian and Italian Catholics.

   Brazilian Catholics and Brazilian non-Catholic Christians. Two of them,
   G80 (“Human species has inhabited planet Earth in the last 100,000
   years”), and G81 (“Different organisms may have a common ancestor”) had
   roughly the same answers in the two groups, with a high proportion of
   the “I would not know how to put it”. Answers to the last item, G83
   (“The first humans were prey to carnivorous dinosaurs”) are evidence of
   a considerable lack of understanding about geological time in both
   groups in Brazil.

   The only truly unexpected result with Intercultural Index (IntcI)
   values was found with item G80, which states "Human species has
   inhabited planet Earth in the last 100,000 years", as the level of
   agreement was lower among Italian Catholics than Brazilian ones (Tables
   ​(Tables11 and ​and2).2). The level of disagreement (around 30%) to
   this statement was higher than agreement (around 20%), and around 50%
   of Catholic Italians preferred not to answer it. In Brazil, the
   situation was also unexpected, as there were no statistically
   significant differences between different religious denominations. The
   abstention of Brazilian religious students was also high (around 56%)
   and the level of disagreement in both groups was low (15%) compared to
   the level of agreement (almost 30%). Therefore, there were significant
   differences between Brazilian and Italian Catholics, but opposite to
   what was expected.

   In this case, Italian youngsters could have taken the statement as an
   exact cipher to be confirmed or not, due to a refined lexicon
   interpretation derived from literal translation. Well-informed students
   about human paleontological details may know that the human species
   appeared longer than 100,000 years before present, and may have decided
   to take the statement as false, or rather to refrain from giving a
   clear opinion. On the Brazilian side, the level of understanding about
   paleontology was lower, as shown by the answers of item G83, leading to
   a decreased level of criticism upon the statement, but with higher
   abstention. The anomalous behavior of the item can also be noticed in
   the two dimensions of the biplot graph, as the degree of association of
   the item with the dimensions of the analysis had the lowest value (see
   S5 Table in the Supporting Information).

   Brazilian Catholics showed a significantly lower level of knowledge
   about geological time than the Italians (Tables ​(Tables11 and
   ​and2).2). However, there were no significant differences between the
   two Christian denominations in Brazil (Tables ​(Tables33 and ​and4).4).
   Thus, the reason for Italians to disagree with the statement of G80
   could be different from that of the Brazilians, showing a polarized
   pattern due to differences in understanding that are related to
   education. Therefore, the answers could have resulted from their
   different level of information, following the general pattern of the
   two samples, and the item was not discarded.

   The results tend to show that those who follow the very same religion,
   listening to the teaching of the very same Catholic religious
   authorities in different countries, had bigger differences regarding
   evolution acceptance from people who were brought up in the same
   socio-cultural environment but followed different religious teachings.
   In addition, differences in understanding tended to follow the same
   pattern. This hypothesis found additional support with the multiple
   correspondence analysis (MCA), analyzing the "true" and "false" options
   in the two religious denominations in the two countries in all items.
   The overall picture can be seen in Fig 1.

   The graph of joint categories (biplot) displays the average scores of
   the two dimensions for individuals belonging to the four categories.
   The origin of the graph represents an individual who belongs to the
   most frequent category of each variable; therefore, profiles that are
   far from the origin indicate groups that are outside of the general
   pattern of the data. There are four clear groups of respondents,
   showing that Catholics do not form a homogenous group. On the contrary,
   Brazilian and Italian Catholics are far from being in the same general
   pattern of answers, confirming what is seen in Tables ​Tables11 and
   ​and22.

   The relative numbers of “true” answers were then compared and the
   module of the differences between Catholics in the two countries
   originated the delta Catholics (ΔCat), as well as the differences
   between Christian denominations in the same country (ΔBChr) used in Eq
   1. The results can be seen in Table 5.

   These results were plotted as shown in Fig 2, which gives a better idea
   of the general results in terms of the relative importance of religion
   (orange polygon) and wider socio-cultural factors within each country
   (blue polygon). The religion borderline assumes that there should be
   small differences between the same Christian denomination (Christian
   Catholic) in the two countries, and higher differences between the two
   different Christian denominations. Therefore, the results appear
   plotted inside the orange polygon. Differences in the understanding of
   geological time followed the same pattern, with a very high score (G83
   IntcI = 7.41), but they were not included in the same figure as they
   are not related to acceptance (see text).

   The area of the small polygon corresponds to the expected result in the
   case that all Christians had similar answers in both countries. The
   blue polygon indicates greater differences between Catholics in both
   countries than differences between the two groups of Christians in the
   same country (Brazil).

Discussion

   Research on evolution education faced a big challenge after the
   surprising findings showing that different instruments lead to
   different rates of agreement/rejection of evolution in the same student
   population [6]. We tried to show that some instruments could have had
   problems in terms of their methodology, implying distortions for the
   numerical analysis, as measurements could result in some bias. These
   distortions can explain, at least in part, the mentioned puzzle. In
   addition, there is not consensus in the educational community about how
   important religion is for the acceptance of evolution.

   We presented a new instrument, stating some principles on how to
   evaluate students’ opinions concerning evolution, asking clear
   positions about well-known statements on the subject and using
   nationwide samples of students of the same age (around 15 years old)
   and absolute anonymity.

   The results show a clear picture of the two countries, which is in line
   with recent data [45], but with a specific focus on two groups of
   Christians, with significant differences between Catholics in Italy and
   Brazil. Moreover, the differences were larger between students from the
   same Christian denomination (Roman Catholic) but different countries
   than from different Christian denominations in the same country
   (Brazil). The MCA found clear distinct groups of respondents. However,
   this is simply an exploratory data technique, and the final picture
   should be seen in a purely descriptive way, without the power of
   indicating a precise output of a statistical test. As the number of
   valid cases involved was not very high (n = 3,881), relative distances
   that can be inferred should be viewed with caution (see S5 Table in
   Supporting Information).

   Item G79 ("Humans are descended from other primate species") was based
   on the well-known instrument “MATE”, keeping the same wording in the
   revised version [8] for the statement about humans, revealing
   difficulties of evolution in 34 countries [2]. Many studies have shown
   that when the human species is concerned, opinions about evolution tend
   to be extreme, with some people considering evolution for all organisms
   except our species [60]. This is perhaps the best item to test the
   hypothesis we have been examining, as the number of respondents of both
   countries was not low (n = 3,117). There was a clear shift between the
   Roman Catholics, with a high acceptance (84.7%) and low rejection
   (5.9%) among Italians, whereas in Brazil, the situation was very
   different, with a significantly lower acceptance (48.5%) and higher
   rejection (21.5%) (Table 1). Within Brazil, differences between
   Christian denominations were lower (Table 3).

   Tables ​Tables33 and ​and44 show that G81 (“Different organisms may
   have a common ancestor”) had no significant statistical differences
   between religious denominations in the same country, and Tables
   ​Tables11 and ​and22 show very significant differences between Roman
   Catholics in the two different countries. As these differences refer to
   the very same religious denomination, which has very similar values and
   beliefs in the two countries, it would be reasonable to expect the
   opposite situation, with no significant differences among people who
   follow the same religious teachings from an early age.

   The level of understanding about geological time was very different
   between Italian and Brazilian Catholics, but a similar level of low
   knowledge was found in both Christian denominations in Brazil. This not
   only adds evidence to the importance of understanding this important
   concept for evolution acceptance, but also shows that education and
   religion have a strong link with nationality, adding evidence to
   previously published studies [6,24]. In our case, Italian Catholics had
   a higher acceptance as well as a higher level of understanding of
   evolution than Brazilian ones. Independent recent research obtained
   similar results, showing that Catholic and Evangelical Brazilian
   university students had low levels of knowledge about evolution [74].

   Notwithstanding this general picture found after the MCA, additional
   evidence in numerical terms supports the idea that religion alone does
   not play a major role in the acceptance of evolution, with the relative
   size of differences obtained by the Intercultural Index (IntcI). It
   tended to show small numbers (IntcI<lt;1) in cases where religion played a
   major role, but the results point in the exact opposite direction, as
   acceptance was far more similar between different religions in the same
   country than between Catholics in the two different countries.

   All IntcI values were higher than 1, reaching values as high as 9, as
   in the case of item G81, which states that different organisms may have
   a common ancestor. This can be regarded as a clear-cut, widely known,
   scientific principle of common ancestry, and a basic principle for
   biological evolution. The calculated Intercultural Index for item G79
   (“Humans are descended from other primate species”) was high (IntcI =
   1.889), showing that differences within Catholics were almost twice as
   high as those between them and non-Catholic Christians in the same
   country (Brazil).

   The general picture shows that religion plays a less important role in
   the acceptance of evolution than nationality, which should be regarded
   as the wide socio-cultural environment, including religion and
   education. Children develop a range of different worldviews, which can
   affect their position towards science and scientific statements [75].
   However, the acceptance of evolution cannot be seen as a simple output
   of a given worldview but as a complex result of several influences.

   No one doubts that literalist interpretations of sacred texts can
   influence the learning processes of young students since early
   childhood. The development of understanding of central concepts can be
   seriously hampered by the influence of fundamentalist religious faith.
   The conceptual discussion about belief, faith, and acceptance
   [49,50,76] may be more worthwhile than creating more research
   instruments.

   The instrument presented here could be applied in different settings,
   and research could be carried out with samples easier to obtain, not
   necessarily nationwide ones. Databanks already providing items with
   clear-cut scientific statements could be recoded, transforming Likert
   scale numbers into true/false answers. Then, the Intercultural Index
   presented here could objectively show the relative importance of
   religion for evolution acceptance. If our results are to be confirmed
   in the future, this could provide considerable consequences for making
   concrete recommendations for evolution education to religious students
   in conservative and anti-science environments.

   It is important to keep in mind that the picture presented here is only
   one frame of a long film, as values are changing very rapidly, even in
   religious settings. For instance, the level of acceptance of evolution
   has improved considerably within members of some conservative Christian
   denominations whose teachings are informed by cultural barriers to
   evolution [35]. Unfortunately, change can also be noticed in the
   opposite direction, with conservative anti-evolution groups and
   religious denominations showing a growing influence around the world,
   Brazil included [39–41,74].

   Additional Editor Comments (if provided):

   This ms addresses an important topic - why does evolution acceptance
   differ? - and takes new approaches to address it.

   I found the results intriguing.

   Still, the reviewers noted several concerns about both the methodology
   of the study and the presentation in the ms. I would like to see the
   authors’ responses to these. think the Introduction can be compressed
   somewhat without loss of information. There are sections - as noted by
   the reviewers - that can be clarified.

   In addition to the comments made by the reviewers, I think the
   presentation of the tables can be improved. Notably, I suggest adding a
   brief descriptor in addition to the G number in each table. So, G75
   could be “planet age”, G76 could be “fossils”, and so on.

   5. Review Comments to the Author

   Please use the space provided to explain your answers to the questions
   above. You may also include additional comments for the author,
   including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or
   publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it
   exceeds 20,000 characters)

   Reviewer #1: This article examines compare acceptance of evolution in
   high school students in Italy and Brazil, specifically looking at 1)
   the overall differences in acceptance between countries 2) whether
   level of acceptance is associated more strongly with a specific
   Christian denomination (Roman Catholic) in both countries, and 3)
   whether acceptance of evolution by both Catholic and non-Catholic
   Christian students within each country are more similar to each other.
   The authors found that the level of evolution acceptance is more
   similar among students within each country than among Roman Catholics
   in both countries. They conclude that "the sociocultural environment
   and level of evolutionary knowledge" is more important than the
   specific religious affiliation they studied (from the abstract), and
   that "religion playing a less important role for the acceptance of
   evolution that nationality" (from lines 648-649). It is an elegant
   study and should be published.

   However, I have some suggestions that I think will strengthen the
   manuscript, listed below. Some are broader and more important, and some
   are more minor.

   1. There are many areas where the article is not clearly written, and
   includes awkward phrasing that I am interpreting as the result of
   English not being the authors' first language. At times this impeded my
   ability to read and understand the article. As PLOS ONE does not
   copyedit accepted manuscripts, I would strongly recommend that the
   authors have a proofreader assist with this issue.

   2. Throughout the paper the authors refer to "different Christian
   religions". I have more often heard this referred to as different
   Christian religious denominations, all falling under the single
   religion of Christianity. The authors should consider changing this
   accordingly.

   3. There are some areas of the introduction which are repetitive (e.g.,
   lines 98-101). I recommend that this section be condensed, and that
   less details of previous studies be provided (e.g., lines 112-125; the
   reader does not need to know the details of how the analysis was done -
   the shorter description of another study in lines 126-131 is a better
   approach).

   4. Since this study focuses on acceptance of evolution among Roman
   Catholic students, the "explicit views on biological evolution
   referenced in 146 should be described in more detail.

   5. I am not sure that reference 35 in line 167 is the appropriate
   reference for that information.

   6. The explanation of why they had the students answer their survey
   anonymously (lines 213-226) was interesting, but there are no citations
   provided for their reasoning. The addition of citations would be
   helpful, or being clear that this is opinion/conjecture. The same for
   their reasoning about why a Likert scale is not appropriate for
   statements expressing scientific facts, as they should not be "graded
   as weak or strong" (lines 243-286). Basically, I would like to see some
   references to survey design to help the reader have confidence that
   their decisions were based on best practices or previous research. I do
   appreciate the nuance that a Likert scale could score different
   approaches to an answer about the age of the planet similarly thought
   they might come from different places of disagreement - precision of
   scientific evidence vs. a non-scientific view (lines 275-280).

   7. Line 358 mentions "personal and family details" - what are these?
   Either explain or omit this.

   8. Line 610 mentions a "well-known instrument" - please include the
   name of this instrument.

   9. Mention the question number of the survey that the results described
   beginning with line 626 come from.

   10. I am concerned about the somewhat strident tone in lines 655-658
   regarding fundamentalist religious faith - not all fundamentalist
   religious people deny "the objective existence of well-founded
   scientific facts". I also recommend removing the word "notorious" in
   line 672 for the same reason.

   11. Which "certain conservative religions" are being referred to in
   lines 671-672? Be explicit.

   Reviewer #2: Thank you for the opportunity to read this manuscript.
   This study follows up on prior work on evolution acceptance in Brazil
   and Italy (“Previous analysis of this sample had already shown
   significant differences between Brazilian and Italian students…”). The
   manuscript makes the claim that culture is more important than religion
   using Catholics in Brazil and Italy. Few would doubt that culture
   matters (or that religion matters) but the question is by how much and
   why does this matter? The study has a very large number of
   methodological weaknesses that need to be addressed.

   Introduction

   The introduction discusses how knowledge and the nature of science
   relate to acceptance, and yet the manuscript did not seem to measure
   these core variables. Differences in these variables between countries
   could explain the acceptance patterns discussed. This was a confusing
   aspect of the introduction and the study.

   The introduction emphasizes “inconsistencies” and “differences” in
   prior research findings relating to acceptance and knowledge. However,
   the contexts of comparison (e.g., ages, countries), magnitudes of
   differences (e.g., effect sizes), meaning of the differences in light
   of the intended measures (e.g., instrument construct definitions), and
   quality of the studies (e.g., sampling, measurement statistics) being
   discussed were not carefully considered. A much more careful and
   rigorous review of the literature is needed. The current introduction
   does not carefully review studies with direct relevance to the
   populations of interest.

   Line 59. The claim regarding “inconsistencies” is not supported by the
   literature. Studies examining different populations with different
   instruments and different levels of education cannot be meaningfully
   compared. Moreover, studies vary greatly in the quality of the measures
   and the rigor of the analyses. Studies of the same populations using
   the same or similar instruments demonstrate few if any differences, and
   those that were found tend to be small effect sizes (many significant
   differences are not meaningful, particularly when using large samples).
   Knowledge and acceptance have a positive association and this is widely
   supported. Claims of contradiction and inconsistency do not align with
   the preponderance of evidence in high quality studies. We can find
   published studies that contradict almost anything, but they tend to
   have significant flaws. Not all studies are equal. A RCT and a static
   descriptive finding are not of the same quality.

   Line 66. The effect sizes for Barnes were not large, and the
   instruments utilized were intentionally designed to measure different
   aspects of evolution acceptance. It is NOT a flaw to intentionally
   conceptualize (and operationalize) a theoretical construct in different
   ways. Why would small differences using instruments that measure a
   construct in slightly different ways be “surprising”? Fahrenheit and
   Celcius are different scales of temperature–is one flawed because it
   produces a different measure? They are based on different
   operationalizations of theory.

   This introduction could be fixed by reviewing findings from
   high-quality studies most similar in terms of religion, age, education,
   etc. to the new research that will be reported.

   Sample

   It is not clear why the two countries are being compared if the Pew
   studies have shown significant differences in evolution acceptance (and
   prior work). A stronger and clearer rationale for the comparisons (in
   light of the methodological issues noted above) needs to be made so
   that readers can see what the authors are trying to do (which is
   interesting).

   Methods

   It was not clear how religious affiliation and religiosity were
   measured–were they separate? These are two well-defined constructs that
   are different.

   The methods discuss measuring evolution acceptance, but later on the
   discussion mentions “understanding” in several places. It was not clear
   if there is a knowledge measure and an acceptance measure. Or are the
   authors conflating acceptance and understanding? This was confusing.
   (e.g., “Difference of geological time understanding followed the same
   pattern, with a very high score”).

   Line 250. It is important to consider that Likert scales by themselves
   are not instruments or measures. Measures are derived from the scale,
   and such scales pose many problems (e.g., non-ratio scaling) that can
   distort inferences. The way that these issues are discussed is
   problematic and should be revised.

   Line 288. The introduction emphasizes that different instruments that
   measure constructs in different ways produce different results, and so
   it was surprising to read that a new instrument that has not been
   widely used was employed in this study. How, then, can the results be
   compared to prior work? It seems that the problems emphasized in the
   introduction are ignored and the authors continue the tradition of
   comparing patterns using different tools. How will this move research
   forward? The methodological approach was puzzling. Regardless, evidence
   in support of instrument quality needs to be expanded as it is
   inappropriate to interpret measures unless there is a robust body of
   evidence supporting them (see Mead et al. evolution Education Outreach
   on instrument quality in evolution education). Please report comparable
   evidence types for the instrument.

   The sampling methods should include information on missing data and
   whether it was missing at random (e.g., did students of particular
   groups have disproportionate missing data?). The participation rate
   should be mentioned in the main text.

   The data have clear nesting and HLM (hierarchical linear models) would
   allow for the analyses of patterns within schools, regions, and
   countries. The current methodological approach is very unusual and so a
   rationale is needed for why MCA was used.

   Why were the data on nationality and religion used to code responses
   when it would be possible to use predictor variables contained within
   the dataset? In other words, the analyses ignore the richness of the
   dataset and predispose the results to the coding scheme. This is
   problematic and poorly justified. Within- and between- group variation
   can be modeled along with interactions.

   The discussion section should emphasize why these results matter. Let’s
   say that the results are well supported by evidence (which is by no
   means clear). How does this change how biologists should approach the
   challenge of evolution education? What are the implications for other
   countries? How should sociocultural factors be measured and included in
   models of acceptance?The discussion section should also include prior
   evolution education research in nonreligious contexts such as China and
   other international studies (please review Donnelly and Deniz Springer
   and other studies).

   Additional Editor Comments

   “Introduction can be compressed somewhat without loss of information”.

   Answer: The introduction has been shortened based on reviewers'
   comments. Changes are specified in the comments for reviewers.

   "I think the presentation of the tables can be improved. Notably, I
   suggest adding a brief descriptor in addition to the G number in each
   table. So, G75 could be “planet age”, G76 could be “fossils”, and so
   on”

   Answer: As suggested, brief descriptors were added to the G number in
   each table.

   Reviewer #1

   “1. There are many areas where the article is not clearly written, (…)
   I would strongly recommend that the authors have a proofreader assist
   with this issue”.

   Answer: The article has undergone English language editing by a
   professional reviewer (MDPI). The text has been checked for correct use
   of grammar and common technical terms, and edited to a level suitable
   for reporting research in a scholarly journal.

   “2. Throughout the paper the authors refer to "different Christian
   religions". I have more often heard this referred to as different
   Christian religious denominations, all falling under the single
   religion of Christianity”.

   Answer: In fact, this is a longstanding problematic issue. Some authors
   criticize the term “denomination”, for instance: “When we use the
   analytical term ‘religion,’ we must not think that it refers to some
   specific, ‘least common denominator’ super- religion or trans-
   religious entity, which can be partitioned into ‘denominations’. No
   such thing exists. All that exists in actuality are particular
   religions.” (Smith, 2017, p.46). However, soon after the same author
   recognizes that this ideal conceptual approach cannot be found in US
   publications, which prefer to call all Christian branches “Christian
   denominations”, as he himself used to call them (Smith, 2000). Roman
   Catholic theologians, such as John Haught, avoid the term; in his
   famous book “Science and Religion: From conflict to conversation”
   (1995), he does not use the expression “Christian denominations”. Thus,
   this way of referring to Christianity as a “trans-religious entity” is
   widely used, as by Thomas Dixon, in his book “Science and Religion: A
   very short introduction” (2008, Oxford University Press). Therefore, we
   decided to modify the expression to the most used/understandable way of
   defining religions in the US and changed all references of “Christian
   religions” into “Christian denominations”.

   “3. There are some areas of the introduction which are repetitive
   (e.g., lines 98-101). I recommend that this section be condensed, and
   that less details of previous studies be provided”.

   Answer: We condensed the discussion in the lines indicated above (lines
   169-170) and elsewhere.

   “4. Since this study focuses on acceptance of evolution among Roman
   Catholic students, the "explicit views on biological evolution
   referenced in L.146 should be described in more detail”

   Answer: We included a brief description of previous studies in Brazil
   carried out in the early 1990s, but consider that the reference that
   was already in the text (Oliveira &amp; Cook, 2019) addresses appropriately
   the issue, which should be seen in a dynamic perspective.

   “5. I am not sure that reference 35 in line 167 is the appropriate
   reference for that information.”

   Answer: This reference is the Pew Research Center report, which
   “examines public perceptions of biotechnology, evolution and the
   relationship between science and religion. Data in this report come
   from a survey conducted across Europe, Russia, the Americas and the
   Asia-Pacific region from October 2019 to March 2020. Surveys were
   through face-to-face interviews in Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic,
   India and Brazil”. The title adopted as bibliographical reference is
   the one recommended by the report.

   “6. The explanation of why they had the students answer their survey
   anonymously (lines 213-226) was interesting, but there are no citations
   provided for their reasoning (…) Basically, I would like to see some
   references to survey design to help the reader have confidence that
   their decisions were based on best practices or previous research.”

   Answer: Strong pieces of evidence published in the literature shows
   that anonymity reduces social desirability distortion and increases
   self-disclosure. This research was part of an international project
   originally designed back to 2004-6 relying on basic literature. Many
   references are available in the literature and we understand that this
   is a well established concept when sensitive issues are involved.
   However, we included two basic references regarding more recent
   research, addressing social desirability, including a meta-analysis
   comprising 51 studies that included 62 independent samples and 16,700
   unique participants.

   “7. Line 358 mentions ‘personal and family details’ - what are these?
   Either explain or omit this”.

   Answer: We introduced one line explaining that the databank includes
   students’ age, gender, religious membership, and socioeconomic
   indicators.

   “8. Line 610 mentions a "well-known instrument" - please include the
   name of this instrument.”

   Answer: We included the name of the “well known instrument” mentioned
   in the article soon after, and a recent reference, but also rephrased
   the first mention of it, in the introduction.

   “9. Mention the question number of the survey that the results
   described beginning with line 626 come from.”

   Answer: The cited number (n=3,117) refers to G79 (“Human origins”), and
   comprises the total number students who answered “true” or “false”
   (“active cases”), in the group of Roman Catholics in Italy and Brazil
   (n=2,731) (Table 1), and Non-Catholic Christians in Brazil (n=386)
   (Table 3), so that 2,731+386=3,117. We added more details in that
   paragraph to make it easier to trace back the numbers.

   10. I am concerned about the somewhat strident tone in lines 655-658
   regarding fundamentalist religious faith - not all fundamentalist
   religious people deny "the objective existence of well-founded
   scientific facts". I also recommend removing the word "notorious" in
   line 672 for the same reason.

   Answer: Both suggestions were accepted and the text was rephrased.

   “11. Which "certain conservative religions" are being referred to in
   lines 671-672? Be explicit.”

   Answer: We introduced some changes in that paragraph, and kept the
   reference, which indicates a concrete example in a given sociocultural
   context.

   Reviewer #2

   A-“The introduction discusses how knowledge and the nature of science
   relate to acceptance, and yet the manuscript did not seem to measure
   these core variables. Differences in these variables between countries
   could explain the acceptance patterns discussed. This was a confusing
   aspect of the introduction and the study”.

   Answer: Our study did not aim at studying deeply the variable we were
   interested for: religion. We tried to throw light on the influence of
   religion in evolution acceptance at a certain age level, with
   probabilistic nationwide samples of two countries with large numbers of
   students who declare themselves as Roman Catholic. It is a far more
   modest objective that examining “how knowledge and the nature of
   science relate to acceptance”. However, the introduction was
   reformulated, trying to let our objectives clearer.

   B-“The introduction emphasizes “inconsistencies” and “differences” in
   prior research findings relating to acceptance and knowledge. However,
   the contexts of comparison (e.g., ages, countries), magnitudes of
   differences (e.g., effect sizes), meaning of the differences in light
   of the intended measures (e.g., instrument construct definitions), and
   quality of the studies (e.g., sampling, measurement statistics) being
   discussed were not carefully considered. A much more careful and
   rigorous review of the literature is needed. The current introduction
   does not carefully review studies with direct relevance to the
   populations of interest.”

   Answer: There are several recent studies on the subject, with different
   methodologies and sampling methods and we were asked to present a more
   concise revision of previous research. As the article is not a
   revision, we tried to meet such a query. Thus, we introduced a
   consideration for the reader to consider the comparison contexts of the
   previously cited studies.

   C-“Line 59. The claim regarding “inconsistencies” is not supported by
   the literature. Studies examining different populations with different
   instruments and different levels of education cannot be meaningfully
   compared. Moreover, studies vary greatly in the quality of the measures
   and the rigor of the analyses.

   Answer: We removed the paragraph that compares studies with different
   populations, leaving the discussion on inconsistencies restricted to
   the study by Barnes et al. (2019) that analyzed the same group with
   different analysis instruments. Deleted paragraph: “"However, data are
   still contradictory and require further investigation. An example of
   inconsistencies found so far is that some studies report a strong
   relationship between evolution acceptance and religious beliefs, while
   other studies report a weak relationship between them [6]. The use of
   different instruments to measure evolution acceptance could be a cause
   of such inconsistent research results."

   D-“Line 66. The effect sizes for Barnes were not large, and the
   instruments utilized were intentionally designed to measure different
   aspects of evolution acceptance. It is NOT a flaw to intentionally
   conceptualize (and operationalize) a theoretical construct in different
   ways. Why would small differences using instruments that measure a
   construct in slightly different ways be “surprising”? Fahrenheit and
   Celcius are different scales of temperature–is one flawed because it
   produces a different measure? They are based on different
   operationalizations of theory.

   Answer: Data venia, apparently the analogy does not seem to be
   appropriate. The mentioned piece of research found differences in the
   very same population using elegant random methods. If one child has two
   thermometers, one reads 35C and the other 101F, it is clear that the
   difference is small, but it does mean something important, as they
   point to two different realities, demanding completely different
   procedures. It makes no sense to choose between Fahrenheit x Celsius
   Scale thermometers in this case. There is no doubt that at least one
   instrument is not working well (if not both!). Small differences can
   indicate completely different realities. Our discussion focuses
   precisely on this point, concerning the construction of instruments. We
   argued that Likert scaling (see below) should not be used with factual
   statements, as this brings imprecise numeric measures. “I like
   strawberry juice” will have a far more precise measure than “strawberry
   is a fruit” in a Likert scale item. Biologists will not fully agree,
   but will not fully disagree either, with the second statement. The same
   would occur with pineapples, apples and pears. However, with tomato
   juice one could expect the opposite situation, as biologists would
   promptly recognize it as a fruit, but as lay costumers use to find
   tomatoes near potatoes in supermarkets, they may disagree with the
   statement, not to mention the sonority of the two words (which is not
   the case with Romance languages). It is not difficult to see that an
   instrument with several such items answered by a large and diverse
   population, in different countries, will bring a cloudy picture due to
   imprecise numeric measures. Our conclusion indicates not only that
   future research should not use Likert scaling with factual statements
   about biological evolution, but also invites reanalysis of data banks.
   This is precisely what we did with our own database, finding surprising
   results.

   E-“This introduction could be fixed by reviewing findings from
   high-quality studies most similar in terms of religion, age, education,
   etc. to the new research that will be reported.”

   Answer: We have included five paragraphs and seven references, with
   studies on acceptance of evolution and Christian denominations of
   similar age level as ours in countries such as India and Chile. The
   paragraphs and references are:

   “A systematic literature review of the current state of research
   regarding students’ and teachers’ acceptance of evolution across Europe
   found that the level of acceptance of evolution in different
   educational settings is ambiguous. The authors argue that similar
   samples and a standardized assessment of the acceptance of evolution
   are necessary for cross-country comparisons [7].

   (…)

   A study with secondary school students (aged 14–16) in the United
   Kingdom found that teaching genetics before teaching evolution had a
   significant impact on improving evolution understanding but did not
   result in a significantly increased acceptance of evolution [16]. This
   reflects a weak correlation between the knowledge and acceptance of
   evolution, which also appears to be present in undergraduate students.
   In Chilean students of 15–16 years old, it was found that including
   instruction on the nature of science in the class on evolution improved
   their acceptance significantly [17].

   Kuschmierz et al. (2020) [7] identified 56 papers from the period of
   2010–2020 regarding students’ and teachers’ knowledge and acceptance of
   evolution across 29 European countries. However, according to the
   authors, the research findings were hard to compare due to the
   application of different instruments and the assessment of different
   key concepts. The available database was not sufficient to obtain
   reasonably comparable data from European countries. In addition, the
   ambiguous results of the research demonstrate multiple challenges
   regarding measurement of evolution education, such as (a) inadequate
   definitions of key constructs (attitudes, acceptance, knowledge, and
   understanding are often not defined or inconsistently used in
   publications); (b) the application of diverse measurement instruments
   (different evolution acceptance instruments may produce different
   results, even when applied to the same population); (c) the
   multidimensionality of knowledge about evolution (most instruments
   focus on single evolutionary constructs, such as natural selection and
   related concepts).

   The authors [18] then developed an instrument to measure attitudes and
   understanding across Europe and beyond, called the “evolution Education
   Questionnaire on Acceptance and Knowledge” (EEQ). The measurement
   instrument was translated into several European languages, in the
   various Romance, Germanic, and Slavic branches, and was recently
   applied to 9200 first-year university students in 26 European countries
   [19].

   This is a recent initiative, and thus, due to a lack of standardized
   assessment procedures in the existing literature, previous results
   should be used with caution when trying to compare countries, as there
   are several limitations, such as different age levels, and sampling
   procedures, etc. [18].

   F-“It is not clear why the two countries are being compared if the Pew
   studies have shown significant differences in evolution acceptance (and
   prior work). A stronger and clearer rationale for the comparisons (in
   light of the methodological issues noted above) needs to be made so
   that readers can see what the authors are trying to do (which is
   interesting).”

   Answer: There is divergence between the two reviewers. The Pew studies
   were carried out with a different age level (18 years old and older),
   with a completely different methodology. We are emphasizing the broad
   sociocultural picture and the need of standardized methodological
   procedures, including careful item translation, aiming at producing
   meaningful comparisons among countries.

   G-“It was not clear how religious affiliation and religiosity were
   measured–were they separate? These are two well-defined constructs that
   are different.”

   Answer: We tried to state clearly that we compared students who
   declared their religion, with no measure of religiosity. Possibly
   language editing has solved this problem.

   H-“The methods discuss measuring evolution acceptance, but later on the
   discussion mentions ‘understanding’ in several places. It was not clear
   if there is a knowledge measure and an acceptance measure. Or are the
   authors conflating acceptance and understanding? This was confusing.
   (e.g., “Difference of geological time understanding followed the same
   pattern, with a very high score”)”.

   Answer: We rephrased the parts where we present the only item that
   relates to geological time. It is not included in the final figure,
   which tried to show the influence of religion on evolution acceptance.

   I-“Line 250. It is important to consider that Likert scales by
   themselves are not instruments or measures. Measures are derived from
   the scale, and such scales pose many problems (e.g., non-ratio scaling)
   that can distort inferences. The way that these issues are discussed is
   problematic and should be revised.”

   Answer: We deleted the phrase “The Likert scale is considered a good
   instrument to estimate the degree of agreement (or disagreement) about
   statements expressing opinions.”, and inserted a more precise
   description of our main criticism of previous instruments:

   “Likert scaling is used in instruments measuring attitudes, beliefs,
   and opinions about statements, allowing expression of moderation of
   opinion from agreement to disagreement. The key point is finding ways
   of calibrating how strongly or mildly a statement should be worded.
   These scales are therefore suitable for issues related to open
   constructs and less for scientific claims based on presumed factuality.
   An item likely to produce extreme responses, either full agreement or
   strong disagreement, would do a poor job of discriminating across the
   full spectrum of respondents [57]. Therefore, Likert scales may not be
   a good choice with statements expressing well-known scientific facts.
   In addition, in the case of theories of evolution, factuality is
   supported by the school context in which the questionnaires were filled
   out. The battery of items on evolution was proposed with dichotomous
   questions given that each of them can have minimal variability”.

   A previous answer (#D) brought additional elements for this discussion,
   but may not be relevant in the context of the manuscript, considering
   writing style and content.

   K-“ Line 288. The introduction emphasizes that different instruments
   that measure constructs in different ways produce different results,
   and so it was surprising to read that a new instrument that has not
   been widely used was employed in this study. How, then, can the results
   be compared to prior work? It seems that the problems emphasized in the
   introduction are ignored and the authors continue the tradition of
   comparing patterns using different tools. How will this move research
   forward? The methodological approach was puzzling. Regardless, evidence
   in support of instrument quality needs to be expanded as it is
   inappropriate to interpret measures unless there is a robust body of
   evidence supporting them (see Mead et al. evolution Education Outreach
   on instrument quality in evolution education). Please report comparable
   evidence types for the instrument.”

   Answer: The issue of comparison was already addressed (see above). In
   addition, we state clearly that our instrument was based on previous
   ones, and not exactly a brand new one, although we did not use Likert
   scale.

   L-“ The sampling methods should include information on missing data and
   whether it was missing at random (e.g., did students of particular
   groups have disproportionate missing data?). The participation rate
   should be mentioned in the main text.”

   Answer: This criticism was, in fact, the most profound and challenging
   one. Our database was searched on five occasions, including the
   doctoral thesis of a specialist in statistics, who studied precisely
   the existing clusters. However, as it is a relatively large database,
   at least in the context of the ROSE Project, the groupings always
   present overlaps that do not allow to figure out so clearly the image
   revealed by the MCA study, focusing on the same religion in the two
   countries. It led us to perform the easy-to-understand numerical
   calculations that resulted in the polygon image. Although we had no
   evidence that the missing cases could be biased, it was necessary to
   carry out a specific study. Thus, a new analysis of the database was
   performed and, now, we can categorically state that there are no
   elements that indicate any bias in the missing cases of the MCA. A new
   set of tables was added to Supplemental Materials (S2 File). A
   paragraph with the conclusion of the analysis was included and reads:

   “The detailed analysis of the occurrence of missing values allows us to
   conclude that there is no indication that the MCA results have any
   significant bias when comparing the responses of valid active cases
   with those with missing values.”

   We included the participation rate in the main text, and kept the
   summary and matrix of the MCA as supplementary materials. We are very
   grateful for the observation, which disturbed our sleep for a few days,
   but which, in the end, made our conclusions more solid.

   M-“The data have clear nesting and HLM (hierarchical linear models)
   would allow for the analyses of patterns within schools, regions, and
   countries. The current methodological approach is very unusual and so a
   rationale is needed for why MCA was used.”

   Answer: As mentioned in the previous answer, usual tests were performed
   on five doctoral theses, which resulted in several articles. However,
   it was not clear that the differences between Roman Catholic students
   from the two countries could be greater than the differences between
   them and Non-Catholic Christian denominations in the same country.

   N-“Why were the data on nationality and religion used to code responses
   when it would be possible to use predictor variables contained within
   the dataset? In other words, the analyses ignore the richness of the
   dataset and predispose the results to the coding scheme. This is
   problematic and poorly justified. Within- and between- group variation
   can be modeled along with interactions.”

   Answer: As mentioned in the previous answers, the richness of the data
   was studied in five doctoral theses, which resulted in several
   articles. One of them (Ocampo &amp; Tolentino Neto, 2020) found different
   typologies of students, which were determined based on the hierarchical
   clustering method. However, the isolation of country and religion from
   the acceptance of evolution was yet to be done. Possibly, the results
   published by research groups from different countries, after our data
   collection, and the growth of conservative and anti-evolutionist
   influence, mainly in Brazil, have been decisive to emphasize the need
   for this particular study.

   O-“The discussion section should emphasize why these results matter.
   Let’s say that the results are well supported by evidence (which is by
   no means clear). How does this change how biologists should approach
   the challenge of evolution education? What are the implications for
   other countries? How should sociocultural factors be measured and
   included in models of acceptance? The discussion section should also
   include prior evolution education research in non-religious contexts
   such as China and other international studies (please review Donnelly
   and Deniz Springer and other studies).”

   Answer: We included new references, but could not include the mentioned
   article (probably Deniz, Donnelly and Yilmaz, 2008), where authors
   discuss other components in someone’s conceptual ecology for biological
   evolution. We believe we pointed out several implications of our
   results, including revising databanks and methodological aspects
   regarding items construction exploring factual scientific statements
   about biological evolution.

Abstract

   Biology seems to present local and transitory regularities rather than
   immutable laws. To account for these historically constituted
   regularities and to distinguish them from mathematical invariants,
   Montévil and Mossio (Journal of Theoretical Biology 372:179–191, 2015)
   have proposed to speak of constraints. In this article we analyse the
   causal power of these constraints in the evolution of biodiversity,
   i.e., their positivity, but also the modality of their action on the
   directions taken by evolution. We argue that to fully account for the
   causal power of these constraints on evolution, they must be thought of
   in terms of normativity. In this way, we want to highlight two
   characteristics of the evolutionary constraints. The first, already
   emphasised as reported by Gould (The structure of evolutionary theory,
   Harvard University Press, 2002), is that these constraints are both
   produced by and producing biological evolution and that this circular
   causation creates true novelties. The second is that this specific
   causality, which generates unpredictability in evolution, stems not
   only from the historicity of biological constraints, but also from
   their internalisation through the practices of living beings.

Introduction

   The evolution of biological forms and functions does not seem fully
   explained by the laws that make physics intelligible (Longo et al.,
   2012). evolution is less a mechanical sequence based on efficient
   causality than a process whose entities are in perpetual change (Dupré
   &amp; Nicholson, 2018; Simons, 2018). It displays a continuity of forms,
   but also a progress: the lineages evolve in certain directions, without
   the space of the possible directions being predetermined. This does not
   mean that there is no stability nor regularity in the evolutionary
   process. On the contrary, evolution appears to be highly channelled. To
   account for biological regularities, Montévil and Mossio have proposed
   a theory of constraints (2015). This concept aims to explain how a
   certain entity can act, at a given moment, on processes. These entities
   are constraints for specific processes: they are local. They are also
   transient because historically constituted (Montévil, 2020). Through
   this concept, the authors manage to explain the relative stability of
   biological systems as a closure of constraints that channel biological
   processes. In this article, we will question the role of these
   constraints in evolution, beyond the scale of biological systems. Our
   aim is to account for their emergence from evolutionary history and to
   understand how they explain, and how they canalise the directions taken
   by evolution. We are therefore less interested in understanding how
   they stabilise biological systems than in identifying the causality of
   these constraints, which makes them a real driving force in evolution
   and generates biodiversity.

   The argument of this article is that biological constraints should be
   thought of as norms when trying to appreciate their causal role in the
   evolution of the biodiversity structure. It has been argued (Longo et
   al., 2012) that constraints in evolution are not necessitating their
   effects but enabling certain evolutionary directions. In this article,
   we wish to take up this idea by analysing more precisely the causal
   force of these constraints in terms of normativity, in order to give a
   concrete account of causation in evolution.

Trying to account for the regularities of evolution

   evolution appears to be a relatively determined and channelled process.
   It displays a certain coherent stability: the evolution undergone by a
   species appears as linear and progressive; we observe similarities
   between organs performing the same function in different lineages. It
   also seems that not all transformations are possible; some morphologies
   may be inaccessible to some species: as Fodor (2007) says, pigs will
   probably never have wings. But although there is now a solid theory of
   evolution based on Darwinism and genetics, it remains difficult to
   comprehensively account for these regularities and to fully identify
   their sources.

Τelos in evolution?

   In order to explain evolutionary regularities, attempts have sometimes
   been made to use the Aristotelian concept of telos. Dennett for
   instance conceives of evolution as the progressive actualisation of the
   different possible phenotypes within a pregiven “Design Space”: “Design
   is Aristotle’s telos, an exploitation of Order for a purpose” (1995, p.
   64), the purpose of an organ adapted to a given ecological problem.
   What would explain the regularity of evolution would be the limited
   number of available solutions, i.e., of possible phenotypes. Beyond the
   shortcomings of such a teleological approach of evolution (Grene,
   1972), the main problem with this conception is that it implies a form
   of fixism or essentialism, which would consist in thinking that all the
   possible biological forms would be given a priori, from all eternity,
   evolution being just the history of their materialization. This leads
   us back to an idealistic vision, of the same type that Darwin already
   refuted, which made the species a form existing from all time. As
   Darwin showed, species is a naturalist’s abstraction, the species being
   merely more pronounced varieties, the evolution of a lineage consisting
   of the gradual transformation of an individual difference into a
   variety, then a species (Darwin, 2001, p. 54; pp. 60–61). There are no
   pre-ordained forms, prior to evolution.

The library of mendel

   Another way of grasping the regularities in evolution (complementary to
   the first) would be to assume that there would be rules preceding
   evolution, given by genetics. This idea is present in Dennett (1995)
   who speaks of a “Library of Mendel” as a genetic repertoire latently
   indicating the possible directions of evolution. It is true that genes
   structure evolution insofar as they carry the information allowing the
   formation of the organism, and a certain number of genes or groups of
   genes are found in different lineages—such is the case of the Hox gene
   which direct the development of the antero-posterior axis in
   vertebrates. But genetic sets change from one species to another, and
   from one organism to another, and more importantly the genetic
   processes themselves evolve over time. For instance, the presence of
   the Pax-6 gene (which is also a development gene but structurally
   distinct from the Hox gene) in several phyla (not only is it present in
   cephalopods and humans, but homologous genes are found in drosophila
   and fish) seems to reveal a strong necessity in the eye’s induction
   processes. But its functioning and expression are specific to each
   species: it controls the action of other genes which are specific to
   different species and whose effect is to result in eyes which are also
   specific. “[…T]he mechanism of eye induction may be conserved across
   the animal kingdom. However, [there is a] dramatic variation of eye
   structure not only between vertebrates and invertebrates, but also
   within the vertebrate lineage” (Neumann &amp; Nüsslein-Volhard, 2000, pp.
   2138–2139). The way in which genes are expressed is not preordained and
   depends on the unique biological situation of the organism, which
   results from evolution itself.

Natural selection and the adaptation requirement

   To account for evolutionary regularities, some have proposed to
   conceive of natural selection as an algorithm that would sort through
   the genetic repertoire. According to Dawkins (1996, pp. 46–50), this
   algorithm should be thought of as follows. A text would be typed
   randomly and copied several times with a certain degree of random
   errors. The computer would choose, among the descending sentences of
   this first set of random letters, the one that would most resemble a
   “target phrase” determined in advance: the closer the phrases would be
   to the target, the more they would reproduce. The action of natural
   selection would be comparable to that of this algorithm which
   eliminates the texts furthest from the target; in evolution, the target
   would be adaptation. Even if it takes different forms depending on the
   situation, adaptation would be maintained as the general form of an
   imperative: that of survival and reproduction. Indeed, lineages persist
   by virtue of the interactions that organisms have with the environment,
   and these interactions are only maintained if they guarantee an
   adjustment of the species to the ecosystem in which they evolve.
   Therefore, adaptation could be considered as the consistent rule of
   evolution, explained by natural selection and that would account for
   the directions taken by the evolutionary process. However, this rule
   appears to be more of an imperative of efficiency (an individual who is
   not able to survive… does not survive), a minimal condition, than a
   real principle of explanation of the form taken by biodiversity and
   morphological evolution.

Failure of these proposals

   All these attempts to account for the regularities in evolution derive
   from a static, nomological view of evolution as resulting from
   immutable laws. This is why they try to account for the observed
   stabilities in a monolithic way, even if it means falling into a
   deflationary explanation that only gives a negative account of the
   directions taken by evolution. Jointly, the entities under
   consideration (organisms, species) are seen as ontologically preceding
   evolution. This is a substantialist view of evolution, outdated since
   Darwin. evolution is the process by which species are generated and
   evolve (let us note that it is species or populations that evolve, not
   individuals); from this point of view, both species and organisms are
   secondary to evolution. They take their forms from this process, and,
   above all, they are transient in respect of the process itself.
   Biological evolution is indeed a process in the strong sense given by
   Dupré and Nicholson (2018, pp. 11–14): it is extended in time, and this
   flow of time means change. Change is thus ontologically primary with
   respect to the entities that it produces. Thus, in biology, “entities”
   appear as “transient patterns of stability” (Ibid., p. 13): organisms
   are constantly changing, species evolve, diverge, become extinct, new
   species arise… They are not fixed entities, but processes that are
   relatively stable (Miquel &amp; Hwang, 2016), or, as Peter Simons puts it
   “precipitates of processes” (Simons, 2018, p. 55). What is fundamental
   in evolution is not the entities, which are always transitory, but the
   dynamic processes that give rise to their relative stability (Soto et
   al., 2016a, 2016b).

   Thus, in order to explain the regularities in evolution, it is
   necessary to move away from a nomological and monolithic approach and
   to take into consideration their historicity.

evolutionary constraints and history

Historical constraints

   Following Gould and Lewontin (1979), we do not deny either the
   necessity of adaptation nor the constraint of the genetic heritage but
   wish to demonstrate that these conditions alone are not enough to
   explain the diversity of forms or the dynamics of the process.
   evolution towards adaptation is subject to multiple other conditions,
   which, as Gould shows (2002, pp. 1027–1037), appear as constraints for
   a pan-adaptive explanation; since they are non-classical factors that
   act differently from what orthodoxy predicts. But they are also real
   constraints since they canalise change, whether they are structures
   inherited from the past or physical determinisms. These constraints
   should not be understood in the sense of mere obstacles, but also in
   their positivity. Gould posits two characteristics of constraint (2002,
   p. 1026):
    1. “Coherent set of causal factors that can promote evolutionary
       change”.^1
    2. “The concept of constraint must include theoretically legitimate
       and factually important positive meanings—i.e., constraints as
       directing causes of particular evolutionary changes—rather than
       only the negative connotations of structural limitations that
       prevent natural selection from crafting an alteration that would
       otherwise be favored and achieved”.

   Gould distinguishes three types of constraint, all of which are linked
   to the history of organisms and thus also of evolution. The first is
   the functional constraint, which comes from natural selection, i.e.,
   the necessity of adaptation, the terms of which are set by the current
   conditions of the environment. It must be stressed that even this
   constraint has a historical dimension insofar as the environment
   sorting out the fitted variations is also shaped by the way organisms
   have lived in and thus transformed this environment. In addition to
   this first “orthodox” constraint, there is the structural one, which
   can come from the direct action of physical laws on the plastic matter
   (an ahistorical phenomenon)—for instance, the fact that flying fish
   fall back into the water because of their mass, is not only a physical
   necessity but a biological aptation (i.e., it is aptive, even though it
   is not an adaptation built by natural selection) (2002, p. 1054). But
   it can also be the constraint of the architectural laws determining the
   appearance of traits as non-adaptive corollaries of other structures,
   which can then be co-opted. Gould gives as an example the correlation
   between the presence of a second row of teeth and the abnormal
   hairiness of Julia Pastrana (Ibid., p. 1055). This correlation is
   determined by homological constraints between hairiness and dentition
   that originate in the phyletic singularity of mammalian development.
   These constraints are born of the evolutionary history of organisms,
   but they can also guide future evolution by canalizing evolutionary
   change. This is the case of the fontanelles, constraints specific to
   vertebrates, due to the development of the skeleton, and which
   subsequently became functional in mammals insofar as they allow the
   skull to deform during the compression of parturition (Darwin, 2001, p.
   180). Finally, there are the genealogical constraints: traits inherited
   from ancestral forms, whether or not it has been shaped by natural
   selection, which constrain and positively orient both the possibilities
   of immediate change and the settlement of the morpho-space.

   To account for the positive dimension of these constraints, Gould
   thinks of their role in the formation of aptive traits. He proposes an
   “aptive triangle” based on the model of the triangle used in petrology
   (Fig. 1). Each of the vertices corresponds to one of the three
   constraints, understood as an influence canalizing evolution. To
   explain the appearance of a trait, all the three vertices should be
   considered (the trait will correspond to a point located inside the
   triangle according to the respective influence of these three idealised
   vertices). However, if the condition of evolution is the adaptation of
   organisms, an adaptation subject to internal constraints, what seems
   fundamental to understanding the respective role of these constraints
   in the appearance of a trait and thus, more broadly, the directions
   taken by evolution, is history. For it is history that explains the
   inhomogeneous distributions of organisms across the potential
   morpho-space of good organic design. The occupation of morpho-space is
   not explained by natural selection alone: it does not represent the
   figure of the best possible solutions to functional problems, but
   depends on a bundle of constraints, which are all ultimately explained
   by history (Gould, 2002, pp. 1055–1056).

   vertices correspond to the different influences on the formation of a
   trait (the trait will correspond to a point located inside the triangle
   according to the respective influence of these three vertices).
   “Standard triangular diagrams for depicting basic causes of form as
   functional (immediate adaptation to current circumstances), historical
   (inherited by homology, whatever the basis of ancestral origin), and
   structural, or arising either as physical consequence of other features
   or directly from the nature of physical forces acting on biological
   materials. All vertices may yield aptive traits of great utility to the
   organism” (Gould, 2002, p. 1052)

The ever-changing space of possibilities

   This conception makes it possible to account for the plurality of
   evolutionary constraints, as well as for their historicity.
   Nevertheless, their action is not only negative: they channel the
   future by opening its possibilities. If constraints were completely
   stable, the evolutionary process would only be entropic, and thus
   predictable: as time progresses, organisms would occupy more and more
   possible places in morpho-space; a decrease in organisation and an
   increase in disorder would be achieved. Yet, what is observed is “a
   decisively non-random, occupation of a theoretical ‘design space’”
   (Gould, 2002, p. 1055), and even an increasing organisation in the
   genealogies and in the organisms (based on the observation that living
   forms become more diverse and complex, Bailly &amp; Longo, 2009; McShea &amp;
   Brandon, 2010) which is opposed to the idea of entropy itself. This
   problem is taken up by Brooks and Wiley (1988). According to them,
   evolution is an entropic phenomenon (because of the variability of
   organisms, the further time goes by, the more possible genotypes, i.e.,
   possible microstates, are occupied by organisms), even though a growing
   organisation in biodiversity is observed, i.e., an increasing distance
   from randomness, both within organisms and in the structuring of
   niches. To understand this, the historical dimension of evolution and
   its constraints must be considered.

   In biology, unlike in physics, history has a special efficacy in that
   it is not the exploration of a pregiven space of possibilities (or
   phase space): the phase space is constantly changing in ways that
   cannot be predicted. Brooks and Wiley conceive this change in terms of
   growth: the more time goes by, the more microstates there would be.
   Organisation would emerge from a difference in rhythm: the increase in
   the phase space would be faster than the realised increase in entropy
   (Fig. 2). Longo, Montévil and Kauffman show that in reality the change
   in phase space is not quantitative. Since the relevant observables in
   biology are not invariants (they are instead characterised by their
   variability, Longo et al. ) and since the constraints that structure
   the phase space are themselves historical (Montévil, 2020), it is the
   very structure of the phase space that changes over time, albeit with a
   coordinated increase in entropy and organisation. This last point stems
   from the fact that the phase space itself is historically constituted.
   It transforms while retaining something of its past structure: the
   ontogenetic constraints, born of evolution, canalise the successful
   realisation of genotypes, even if the genotypes not realised may be
   accessible microstates; certain genotypic combinations are also made
   impossible by the fact that speciation has distributed genetic
   information across different lineages over time (lineages that do not
   reproduce each other).

   The entropy in evolution, redesigned from Brooks &amp; Wiley, (1988, p.
   40). The difference between H[max] (increasing entropy maximum) and
   H[obs] (the observed entropy) is organization, while the value of Hobs
   is a measure of the entropy of the system. If this scheme is applied to
   evolutionary lineages (1988, p. 43), H[obs] measures the historically
   realized diversity. The historical exclusion of the expression of
   certain kinds of information is measured by the difference between
   H[max] and H[obs]. The aera above H[max] corresponds to impossible
   combinations because no novelties exist (at the time observed). But
   what is impossible at one moment may become possible at a later time
   period. It can also be applied to represent the gap between the number
   of possible genotypes H[max] and the distribution of observed genotypes
   H[obs] (1988, pp. 44–45)

   Therefore, it is the historical dimension of constraints that gives
   them their positive dynamic. Constraints in evolution emerge from the
   evolutionary process and orient it by redefining the space of
   possibilities. Not only do they canalise change as they prevent
   biological systems from occupying all possible genetic configurations,
   but they themselves evolve in such a way that the space of
   morphological phases is constantly changing: they create new
   possibilities, which will become new constraints (Montévil, 2019). It
   is this creative dimension that must now be investigated.

Biological interactions and evolutionary norms

   To understand how these constraints can emerge from evolution while
   canalising it, it is necessary to grasp the very process of evolution
   in its concreteness. Dupré and Nicholson define it, in the same way as
   rain, light or fermentation, as an unowned process (2018, p. 12),
   because the entities of this process are not its substrates but its
   precipitates. Yet, in evolution, the precipitates are at the same time
   the transitory agents of this process, for evolution is the history of
   the interactions of living beings. As Fisher writes, the motor of
   evolutionary change is “in the actual life of living things; in their
   contacts and conflicts with their environments, with the outer world as
   it is to them; in their unconscious efforts to grow, or their more
   conscious efforts to move. Especially, in the vital drama of the
   success or failure of each of their enterprises” (1950, p. 184). Thus,
   it could be said that since evolution belongs to no one in particular,
   it belongs to everyone: it is a process knotted by interactions whose
   agents are in in(de)finite number, that is to say knotted by an
   indefinite number of processes (the agents being, as we have seen,
   stabilised processes).

Constraints and interactions

   Indeed, if the horizon of evolution is the adaptation of organisms to
   their environment, this constraint is dynamic: it comes from a history
   and shapes this history. It is not a constraint imposed unilaterally
   and externally by the environment but is constituted by the history of
   the interactions of organisms with their environment, as they also
   transform this environment. The causality is not unilinear. It cannot
   be said that the niche causes the means of survival of the living being
   and its evolution, since the niche is what allows the living being to
   survive (by definition, otherwise it would not evolve in this precise
   environment). The phenotype of a living being, and its niche are
   defined by each other; hence, no causal priority can be given to one or
   the other (Fodor &amp; Piattelli-Palmarini, 2011). Niches are not waiting
   to be filled until the day when miraculously the right phenotype
   appears. The evolution of the forms of living beings cannot be
   understood as responses to the constraints set by the environment,
   since environment and its stakes are defined on the basis of phenotypic
   traits that are supposed to be adaptations: “But that there are
   spiders, who would have guessed how to spin webs to catch flies is an
   ecological problem?” (Ibid., p. 140). Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini
   denounce an inverted reasoning of the type: locks exist for keys to
   open them, rather than keys are made to open locks. They answer the
   question of this chapter “Did the dodo lose its ecological niche? Or
   was it the other way around?”: “The extinction of the dodo was the very
   same event as the extinction of the dodo’s way of making a living so
   neither can serve to explain the other” (Ibid., p. 147). The constraint
   emerges from the horizon represented by the niche: it is neither given
   by the environment unilaterally nor by organisms.

   It is the history of the co-construction of the niche that supplies the
   conditions for the survival of organisms and species, thereby
   channelling the evolutionary process in certain directions that will
   produce the new constraints of the niche. Thus, these constraints are
   the products of interactions, i.e., concrete, practical relations,
   which involve agents: the living beings in relation with each other and
   with their environment. Living beings are not (necessarily) cognitive
   agents, but they are agents insofar as they actively take part, through
   their interactions, in evolutionary history. “An updated account of
   evolution […] should, at least, represent adaptive evolution […] as the
   interaction of agents and their affordances. It should take seriously
   the Darwinian insight that evolution is the direct consequence of what
   organisms do” (Walsh, 2015, p. 241). Hence, constraints in evolution
   should rather be thought of as norms.

Normative interactions

   This does not mean that it is the agents who directly behave
   normatively, but that their interactions have a normative part. To
   capture this, Brooks and Wiley use the image of a playground (1988, p.
   83). Organisms impose constraints which come from their genealogy and
   define the conditions of their self-organisation. There is also an
   “ecological hierarchy” which refers to the relationship between
   organisms and their environment and which defines another type of
   constraint: boundary conditions. The latter give the playing field,
   where the constraints of the organisms produce the rules of the game.
   Several games can be played on the same field, but only one at a time.
   Biological systems therefore obey organisational rules, and their
   playground is the boundaries defined by the planet. evolution is the
   meeting of changes in the rules of the game and of correlative changes
   in the dimensions of the playing field, inasmuch as these changes are
   reflected in the biological interactions of organisms.

   So far, we have discussed the interaction of organisms with their
   environment, but evolution depends on multiple interactions that go far
   beyond this bilateral relationship. As Darwin himself pointed out, it
   relies on the intensity of the struggle for existence, which is not
   only a struggle with the environment, but a struggle between individual
   agents for access to resources that can take very various forms.
   Although we cannot exhaustively illustrate the complexity of the
   interactive processes at work in evolution (which range from
   competition between cells in development to the differentiated
   extinction of species in catastrophic upheavals), we will nevertheless
   give an example: that of competition between species.

Interactions of wolbachia

   One aspect of this competition is the relationship between the parasite
   and its host. This relationship has a normative dimension in that it
   channels the evolution of the two species involved, but this
   channelling is highly dependent on the way the biological agents
   interact in their unique biological situation. The interaction of the
   bacterium Wolbachia with different insects is a remarkable example. In
   the hymenopter Asobara tabida, Wolbachia is indispensable for the
   ovogenesis of its host (Dedeine et al., 2001). But in most other
   insects, Wolbachia is a reproduction parasite. In Hypolimnas bolina, it
   kills males in the embryonic stage, conserving only females (Dyson &amp;
   Hurst, 2004). In the woodlouse Armadillidium vulgare, Wolbachia doesn’t
   kill males but induces the development of woodlouse embryos into
   females, irrespective of the sex chromosomes carried by the embryos
   (Cordaux et al., 2011). In Armadillidium vulgare, there is chromosomal
   sex determination based on female ZW/ZZ heterogamety. But when
   genetically male embryos carry Wolbachia, they develop into functional
   females. Wolbachia thus clearly increases its reproduction since
   instead of being in a male which will not transmit it to any of its
   descendants, it is in a female which will transmit it to almost all its
   descendants. In addition, Wolbachia can pass on its f genetical factor
   which feminises males (once f is passed on, there is no need for
   Wolbachia to be present for feminisation). Some populations of ZZ
   females can even be found without the presence of the Wolbachia
   bacterium (Leclercq, et al., 2016). However, the nuclear genes carried
   by the majority sex in the population are disadvantaged. The risk is
   that there will be no more male, and therefore no further reproduction
   of the woodlouse. As a result, genetic resistances to feminisation have
   been observed in natural populations of Armadillidium vulgare: mainly
   the M gene which is able to restore the male phenotype in the presence
   of f (Rigaud &amp; Juchault, 1993); but also, a polygenic system that has
   no direct impact on the phenotype but limits the rate of transmission
   of Wolbachia to the offspring (Rigaud &amp; Juchault, 1992). Another form
   of resistance, also present in Hypolimnas bolina (Charlat et al.,
   2007), is the development of a strong copulatory capacity in woodlouse
   males (Moreau &amp; Rigaud, 2003). Interactions with Wolbachia have very
   different evolutionary consequences from one species to another, but
   also within populations of the same species. It should also be
   underlined that the resistances are passed on from one generation to
   the next. The interaction has therefore created new constraints in the
   long term, through genetic changes. The constraint of adaptation here
   translates into the fact that the woodlouse must evolve to survive (it
   is a good example of the Red Queen hypothesis, Van Valen, 1973). The
   genetic constraint is also involved: evolution depends on the genetic
   variability available. But what really allows these constraints to
   orient evolution and transform the process from which they emerge, is
   the normativity of the interaction itself, as it takes different forms
   from one species to another, and from one population to another.

   This normativity of interactions is crucial in medical biology to
   understand diseases (see Méthot &amp; Alizon, 2015). The virulence of a
   microbe, for instance, depends on the specific interaction between the
   pathogen and its host: a microbe is not intrinsically pathogenic, it is
   the relationship with its host that will define whether it is
   pathogenic. In addition, some microbes, initially non-pathogenic on a
   particular host, may subsequently evolve and become pathogenic to that
   host. This property of pathogenic or not, which seems to be a normative
   property par excellence ‘good’ or ‘bad’, depends on the host, the
   microbe, and their interaction. It is by understanding this normative
   relationship that we can grasp the direction taken by evolution. If the
   parasite is not pathogenic, then there can be co-evolution with its
   host; if it is weakly pathogenic, there can be an ‘arms race’; if it is
   highly pathogenic, this can lead to the extinction of the host species.

   These interactions also define their own evolutionary norms in relation
   to their environment. Let’s consider two species of birds from
   different lineages. The first, due to its evolutionary history, can
   only feed on berries while the second can feed on both berries and
   seeds. Suppose that the environment contains berries and seeds in equal
   proportion: it can be assumed that the species that feeds on both
   berries and seeds will feed on the seeds, so as not to compete with the
   other species. Here there are evolutionary processes coming from
   speciation that meet and structure the ecological space. In return,
   this patterning has a retroactive effect on the evolution of these two
   species: the second species may come to lose its ability to ingest
   berries. It is in the reciprocal influence of constrained processes
   that evolutionary normativity emerges.

   Thus, the role of biological constraints in the directions taken by
   evolution depends on the diversity of organisms and their particular
   ecological situation. It is these various concrete interactions that
   explain the creativity of constraints, and which make it necessary to
   speak, in the case of evolution, of evolutionary norms.

evolutionary norms

   The word norm is used in specific cases in biology: the normal versus
   the pathological in medical biology (a polarity famously conceptualised
   by Canguilhem, 1966), or in the established expression “norms of
   reaction” dealing with phenotypic plasticity (West-Eberhard, 2003;
   Woltereck, 1909). We speak of norm in a broader sense, since it is the
   very causality at work in evolution that we propose to think of as
   normative. In order to draw up an operational definition of the concept
   for evolutionary biology, let us review its different meanings. Apart
   from the strictly mathematical sense, we identify three main meanings,
   based on the definitions listed by Merriam-Webster Dictionary and ATILF
   Lorraine (which relates to the French word, but is more detailed):
    1. A regular state in relation to an average.
    2. A state of conformity in relation to an average, which then takes
       on the value of an “ideal type”.
    3. A standard to which one refers to judge, but also to act. Thus, in
       human productions, the norm takes on the meaning of a “rule, law in
       an artistic, scientific or technical field; conditions that must be
       respected in an accomplishment; prescription that must be followed
       in the study of a science, the practice of an activity, an art”
       (ATILF—CNRS &amp; Université de Lorraine, our translation). It is not a
       rule only for judgment, but for practice. Another important
       characteristic is that it depends on the socio-cultural context,
       which is itself changing; it emerges from practices. This
       definition emphasises the dynamic dimension of the norm: it gives
       directions to a practice, and it emerges from a particular context
       which comes from the very history of this practice: it is therefore
       historical or evolutionary. The norm has both a creative positivity
       (its power does not only consist in a limitation but also in the
       fact that it constitutes opportunities) and emerges from and
       structures the interactions and practices of agents who live these
       norms.

   (a) and (b) are static definitions, and therefore are not adequate for
   thinking of evolution. It is from (c) that we think we should speak of
   norms in the evolutionary process although leaving aside the cultural
   framework. These norms are:
    1. Transitory rules which are,
    2. Both produced by and producing a historical process, and
    3. Have a creative dimension (they do not only limit or constrain the
       process, but transform the space of possibilities)
    4. Deriving from the fact that they are internalised in interactions,
       i.e., practices giving them their power and normative meaning.

   Grasping this normativity of biological constraints in evolution also
   allows us to understand their causal modality, beyond traditional logic
   and a substantialist conception of evolution. It is not just a matter
   of replacing one word with another: constraints in evolution do have a
   normative power.

The normative power of evolutionary constraints

Their positive value

   Biological constraints are not necessitating causes (Longo et al.,
   2012): they do not cause a predetermined effect. Nor can they be said
   to actualise possibilities, since as we have seen, the possible is not
   predefined in biology. They form opportunities for evolution itself
   (see also Jacob, 1977 or Caporael et al., 2014), opportunities that
   were not predicted, and which generate real novelties.

   This is why Montévil speaks of constraints as possible innovations:
   “the constraint plays a role, and this role is performed in a specific
   manner by generating other constraints” (Montévil, 2019, p. 4574). He
   takes the following example: “articulated jaws enabled teeth such as
   molars which can crush food. However, crushing food with the mouth was
   and still is not an actual possibility at all for Chordates without
   articulated jaws” (Ibid., p. 4575). The evolutionary novelty of
   articulated jaws is part of the organisation of an organism in such a
   way that it becomes a structural constraint, but also widens the space
   of possibilities in the organism by offering the opportunity for a new
   function: crushing food. The emergence of the first novelty
   (articulated jaws) is a necessary ingredient for the second novelty
   (teeth) to be able to play a functional role (crushing food). Thus, new
   traits allow secondary novelties that could not have been foreseen
   before the appearance of these new traits. And it is by this very fact
   that innovations acquire their constraining aspect in the sense of a
   stabiliser: “a novelty may become deeply integrated into certain
   biological organizations, making its complete disappearance unlikely to
   be viable” (Ibid., p. 4576). Both a channelling force and a breeding
   ground for innovation, evolutionary constraints have both aspects (1)
   and (2) of norms. We may add from the example we have just studied that
   it also has a creative dimension (3).

The creative circularity of constraints

   But to better appreciate (3), let us consider a more paradigmatic
   example found in Gould, which highlights the creativity of constraints
   by revealing the diversity of meanings they can take on in the course
   of history. This example follows on from an excerpt of The Genealogy of
   Morals by Nietzsche on historical research, that Gould (2002, p. 1216)
   uses to think of evolution: “‘Namely, that the origin or the emergence
   of a thing and its ultimate usefulness, its practical application and
   incorporation into a system of ends, are toto coelo [entirely, or
   literally ‘to the highest heavens’] separate; that anything in
   existence, having somehow come about, is continually interpreted anew,
   requisitioned anew, transformed and directed to a new purpose’”. Rather
   than simply referring to cases of exaptation (a change in function of a
   structure in the course of evolution), Gould gives an example of what
   could be called an “overloading” (Longo, 2018, pp. 457–458) which
   further reveals the abundant and unpredictable creativity of
   evolutionary constraints. While Gould does not embrace the full
   Nietzschean analysis, he “do[es] appreciate Nietzsche’s point, which
   can be translated into evolutionary terms as the source of constraint”
   (Gould, 2002, p. 1218). He adds: “The original reason does continue to
   exert a hold upon history through the structural constraints that
   channel later usages. Once feathers originate for thermoregulation, the
   form of any later utility for flight will be influenced by features
   built for the original context” (Ibid.). This diversion through
   Nietzsche underlines the fact that the historical constraints that have
   come to crystallise in evolution also constitute reserves of
   potentialities. Gould refers to the remarkable case of overloading
   found in the black heron Egretta Ardesiaca, which uses its wings to
   shade the shallow water of its habitat, “thus providing a clear view of
   available prey” (Ibid., p. 1225). It is implausible that the wings
   originally evolved for the sole purpose of shading so that the herons
   could better see their prey. On the other hand, it is probable that
   wings evolved in the context of the advantage that flight presented for
   these animals, and that subsequently this structural adaptation may
   have taken on another possible meaning: that of shading to find prey.
   But Gould goes even further back: in fact, it is likely that “feathers
   were initially coopted for flight in a much older functional shift, a
   defining transition in avian phylogeny from a different initial role,
   perhaps in thermoregulation” (he refers to Kingsolver &amp; Koehl, 1985;
   Gould, 2002, p. 1226). This example enriches the aptive triangle by an
   excess at the level of the functional vertex, which would come from the
   creative circularity of the different constraint vertices (Fig. 3). The
   causality is thus less rectilinear than circular. And there would be a
   sort of indefinite accumulation at the functional level, an
   accumulation which is no longer so much structural (even if it is
   accompanied by phenotypic changes) as semantic.

   that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is
   40656_2022_483_Figc_HTML.gif indicate the various meanings that these
   constraints can take on for the organism. They usually appear
   successively. They may be contemporary with each other (functional
   overload), or on the contrary be mutually exclusive (exaptation). These
   different meanings are not predictable because they arise from the
   causal circularity of the constraints which are themselves transitory

A continual reinterpretation

   There is a causal circularity coming from the perpetual
   reinterpretation of the constraints by the organisms which make them
   true evolutionary norms. From this perspective, it should be underlined
   that some constraints did not emerge from the functional vertex: there
   are some actual aptive features which were originally non-aptations.
   Their evolutionary meaning changed in the course of history. This is
   the case of the fontanelles we mentioned. This also the case of the
   repetitive DNA that Gould and Vrba describe as “nonapted features,
   available for cooptation later, but not serving any direct function at
   the moment. When coopted, they will be exaptations in their new role
   (with secondary adaptive modification if altered)” (1982, p. 11).
   Another example provided by Gould (2002, pp. 1282–1284) which will
   enable us to apprehend the evolutionary dynamics of these constraints,
   this time on an ecological scale, is that of Linepithema humile. In
   Argentina, these ants split into colonies of genetically closer
   individuals, colonies that compete with each other, with the result
   that the entire species remains at relatively low population density
   levels. This is not the case in California. The population of ancestors
   of the ants that invaded California presented a genetic bottleneck (the
   population probably came from a single indigenous colony in Argentina).
   Being all very close genetically, they formed a single large colony of
   ants which quickly invaded California, their population not being
   regulated by inter-colonial conflicts. Their ecological success in
   California paradoxically stems from the disappearance of an adaptation
   (colony recognition) induced by the loss of genetic diversity. Hence,
   the constraint represented by the loss of diversity proved adaptive in
   this particular context and transformed the Californian biotope. It
   should be added that this feature could also prove to be “pathological”
   in the event of sudden environmental changes, since the lack of
   competition could again lead to a genetic drift that would either lead
   to a situation like that in Argentina, or to extinction.

   These examples show the creativity of constraints (3) through their
   perpetual reinterpretation. They reveal the way in which these
   reinterpretations emerge from evolution itself, as a historical process
   (2), while at the same time channelling that same process (1). But it
   is (4) that is crucial to understanding the modality of their causal
   power. Gould often refers to constraints as forming “reservoirs of
   potential” (2002, p. 49) and as generating evolvability (Ibid., pp.
   1270–1295). He writes about the genetic development pathways: “the
   constraints of these rules have provided more flexibility in their
   fecund channels than limitations through their 'forbidden places'”
   (Ibid., p. 1272). But how do these constraints orient evolution towards
   non-determined possibilities? How do they induce evolutionary change?
   By what causality do they channel evolution? There are two
   indissociable questions here: what is the exact modality of their
   causal power? And where do they get this causal power from? This is
   where we think it is crucial to understand evolutionary constraints as
   norms: these two questions are resolved if the power of these
   constraints is understood as normative.

Trying to think modality beyond Aristotelian categories

   In Aristotle (2017, pp. 12, 21a35—13, 23b27), there are four
   fundamental modalities. The possible (that which does not imply
   contradiction and can therefore be true) is the contradiction of the
   impossible (that which implies contradiction, i.e., that which cannot
   be true); the necessary (that which cannot be otherwise than it is and
   therefore cannot not be true) is the contradiction of the contingent
   (that which could have been different from what it is; its contrary was
   also possible, i.e., it can be false). These four modalities imply a
   pre-determined space of possibilities, and hence appear insufficient
   for thinking of the causal force of evolutionary constraints, and of
   their potential. Most physical laws entail a necessity: they indicate
   that, in a given situation, if the conditions are met, the effect will
   occur. But biological constraints do not necessitate as physical laws
   do. Their historicity and the multiplicity of singular processes that
   characterise the situations in which they are actualised make them
   shifting norms that do not display a predictive uniformity. And yet, if
   they widen the possibilities of evolution, they allow the organisation
   of biological phenomena, in so far as evolution is not a process that
   would tend more and more towards randomness. This is why their
   normative power cannot be considered as part of the category of
   possibility either. They orient evolution in such a way that it does
   not realise just any possibility, but some possibilities rather than
   others: the most functional and relevant ones, the possibilities
   leading to an increasingly organised evolution.

   Mumford and Anjum seek a third modal path between necessity (and its
   contradictory: contingency) and possibility (and its contradictory:
   impossibility), because these categories do not allow for an account of
   the canalising power of processes (2018a, pp. 31–35) which they speak
   of in terms of tendency. Processes tend in certain directions, without
   these directions being necessitated, nor having the status of mere
   possibilities. The modal status of the tendency would be irreducible to
   the traditional modalities and would lie somewhere between pure
   necessity and pure contingency (Mumford &amp; Anjum, 2011, p. viii). They
   call this modality dispositional and ground it on a metaphysical
   conception of reality that conceives of all causality in terms of
   process (Ibid., p. ix).^2 In Getting causes from powers, the
   dispositional modality is described as follows: given a cause A, the
   effect B is not just one possibility among others; A tends to manifest
   B if nothing prevents it. However, this formulation fails to really
   break out of the traditional logic because it could be connected to a
   sense of contingency already present in Aristotle: ὡς ἐπὶ τὸ πολύ (what
   most often occurs, 2009, I 3, 25b14 and I 13, 32b7) and which is
   statistic. Mumford and Anjum write that the dispositions are “disposed
   to happen in a non-negligible probability” (2011, p. 181). Moreover, it
   seems that dispositional modality is not irreducible to necessity,
   since it could be described in terms of conditional necessity (the
   expected effect occurs if other causes do not interfere). According to
   Sinclair (2019), in order to account for this sui generis modality, one
   would have to go beyond external manifestation and say something about
   the internal force, insofar as it may not come to manifestation. This
   is what Mumford and Anjum propose in What tends to be when they argue
   that a tendency is an internal force that may produce an effect without
   requiring it but may also not come to its manifestation even though
   there is nothing to prevent it (2018a, pp. 17–18). The force or power
   in its manifestation is intrinsically a function of tendency rather
   than necessity. It is the power of a causal process constituted by its
   temporal thickness: it takes time to unfold, a time during which “some
   properties will be lost, and new properties and new interactions might
   be introduced” (Ibid., p. 80). Sinclair (2019) tends to account for
   this last point by calling on the internal experience of inclination
   that would allow us to think concretely of dispositional modality by
   revealing the efficacy of the very duration of the process. It is also
   this processual dimension that Mumford and Anjum emphasise to conceive
   causality in biology, a realm characterised by perpetual change and
   activity (2018b). They give the example of pregnancy: it can be thought
   that it goes from cause (the sexual act) to effect (the birth of a
   child). However, pregnancy is not a linear process going from
   reproduction to birth; many other processes are at stake which interact
   with and even contribute to this primary process: bodily,
   physiological, hormonal changes…

Normative modality and biological practices

   But this approach seems insufficient for biological evolution, in two
   respects. On the one hand, it does not account for the reconfiguration
   of the space of possibilities specific to biological evolution. The
   authors conceive the dispositional modality as applying to any
   phenomenon. They underline that there are degrees of possibilities,
   which seem to be linked to probability. Yet, probability is a measure
   on a given space of possibilities. Thus, they do not address the truly
   innovative nature of the possibilities created during evolution. The
   authors investigate the causal link between A and its typical
   manifestation B. But in evolution, B is not predetermined, and is
   therefore not predictable no matter how much information is available
   about A. It is no coincidence that the biological example given by
   Mumford and Anjum is not borrowed from evolutionary biology. In
   evolution there are no typical manifestations, only special cases. As
   Longo puts it «biological events are rare […] in view of their
   biological specificity or historicity: each event is individually rare,
   even if this type of events happens continually in evolution and
   contribute to the construction of all phylogenetic paths” (2018, p.
   469). On the other hand, the authors underline the close link between
   the manifestation of the effect and the continuity of the process that
   causes it, but do not account for the fact that, in evolution, the
   causality displays a creative circularity: the evolutionary norms, are
   both produced by and producers of the evolutionary process. They
   indicate that what accounts for dispositionality in biology is the fact
   that life is made up of activities, but do not directly link these
   activities with their conception of causality.

   We believe, on the contrary, that these activities must be at the
   centre of a conception of causality in evolution, since it is they that
   account for the creativity of evolutionary constraints as well as their
   specific causality. It is because constraints arise from interactions
   that are woven by agents, and because, from this point of view, they
   constitute real biological norms, that they have the power to canalise
   evolution. To understand the causality of constraints in evolution, it
   is therefore necessary to take into consideration the agency of living
   beings. For it is living beings that internalise and manifest them
   through practices, i.e., activities that are embedded in and transform
   their living conditions and thus the rest of evolution. This is why, to
   envision this driving role of organisms in evolution, Walsh proposes an
   agent theory. For ecological constraints, for example, to have a truly
   positive action, they must form opportunities for organisms. Hence, the
   latter must be true agents, i.e., beings capable of experiencing these
   conditions as affordances and of responding to them through practices
   likely to transform these very conditions (Walsh, 2015, p. 163). The
   living themselves actively constitute the constraints to which they are
   subject, through their agency (Ibid., p. 173). Thus, the power of the
   evolutionary constraints comes from their normative part, from the way
   in which living beings internalise them in activities that create new
   constraints that can transform evolutionary history. If we look back at
   the example of the functional overloading of the black heron’s wings,
   the morphological constraint (the feathers) resulting from the
   adaptation of thermoregulation constituted a crucial opportunity since
   it enabled the heron to fly. The practice of flight by the heron led to
   a selection such that the proto-wings became real wings: this practice
   was actualised in a morphological constraint, underpinned by genetic
   processes. And in return, this constraint allowed the emergence of a
   further new practice (and therefore also a new function) through the
   use of the parasol wing. The creative circularity of evolutionary
   constraints becomes illuminating when they are understood as norms
   whose multiple meanings arise from the concrete practices of organisms
   conceived as biological agents. Similarly for the diverse interactions
   of Wolbachia: it is within each interaction, in the way it is
   concretely tied up by the agents involved, that evolvability is played
   out. Neither the historical, morphological and ecological data nor the
   imperative of adaptation determine the directions taken by evolution.
   Instead, these constraints act as norms that living beings internalise
   into biological activities canalising future evolution. Let us
   emphasise that internalisation here is not psychological nor
   subjective: living beings are not necessarily cognitive agents, but
   they are agents insofar as they experience these biological norms in
   the particularity of their situation and transform them by their
   likewise particular practice. The changes in meaning of the black
   heron’s wing, or of the interaction of host and parasite, do not
   require a passage through conscious subjectivity, but only a passage
   through the activity of the living as historical interactions that
   constantly transform the constraints they inherit into new
   possibilities.

   This leads us to the first point that the dispositional modality failed
   to account for: the change in the space of possibilities, and thus the
   unpredictability of evolution. The various consequences of the presence
   of Wolbachia on the evolution of its host reveal the importance of the
   internalisation of norms in interactions which are always particular
   cases. The biological norm is always local and transitory, i.e.,
   specific to a time and place in evolutionary history. And it is within
   these “rare” conditions—in the sense given by Longo (2018): specific,
   historical—that living beings experience these norms through practices
   that are also rare. Therefore, it is because evolutionary constraints
   constitute norms for living beings that they can be truly innovative:
   they owe their power to the way organisms internalise them. They arise
   from the evolutionary process as it is shaped by the activities and
   practices of living beings, but they also channel this process, and
   even generate its future possibilities, through internalisation, i.e.,
   the way in which living beings experience these norms and actualise
   them through practices in the specificity of their unique situation. It
   is precisely because these norms are internalised in the practices of
   particular agents in specific situations that evolution is truly
   unpredictable (the phase space is perpetually changing).

   The outcome B is not predictable from the norm A, because the very
   possibility of B emerges from the way particular agents internalise A
   through an equally particular or rare practice C. It is from this
   internalisation that biological constraints derive their power: they
   become norms for evolution.

Conclusion

   Our aim was to clarify the causal power of biological constraints on
   the evolution of biodiversity. We argued that this power became
   illuminating if thought of in terms of normativity. We began with a
   critical moment aimed at identifying the inadequacies of the
   explanations traditionally proposed to account for regularities in
   biology. Moving away from these nomological, often monolithic, and in
   any case static conceptions of evolution, we proposed an analysis of
   the multiple constraints that canalise the forms taken by biodiversity.
   We highlighted that these constraints were historical, and that this
   history was woven by the interactions of living beings. We then studied
   these interactions to show that they had a normative dimension: they
   may be vital or fatal for the survival of organisms, and they redefine
   their conditions of existence. This led us to reconceptualise
   biological constraints in evolution in terms of evolutionary norms,
   embracing four characteristics. They appear as binding conditions for
   biological evolution (1), deriving from the evolutionary process
   itself, while channelling it and opening its future possibilities (2).
   These possibilities are not predetermined in a predefined phase space
   (3) but emerge from the very way in which living beings internalise
   these norms in practices specific to their particular situation (4).
   Finally, we have shown that conceiving biological constraints in
   evolution as evolutionary norms allows us to shed light on the modality
   of their causal power, inadequately captured by the categories of
   traditional logic inherited from Aristotle, while accounting for the
   nature of the entities at stake: biological agents. This concept of
   normativity is not intended to replace the existing work on
   constraints, nor the work on process biology, but it is meant to
   elucidate the role of constraints on the directions taken by biological
   evolution, bringing forward the agency of living beings.

Footnotes

   ^1Insofar as he wants to distinguish these constraints from the
   “classical”, i.e., functionalist, causes of Darwinism, he restricts his
   definition of constraints to morphological structuralism.

   ^2It should be stressed that the modality they propose is rooted in a
   metaphysics of powers that presuppose a non-necessitarian conception of
   causality in general, and not just for certain processes. We do not
   wish to get into such a metaphysical consideration but use their model
   to consider the modality of biological phenomena, insofar as it allows
   us to overcome Aristotelian logic by thinking causality in a processual
   way.

An introduction to evolution

The definition

   Biological evolution, simply put, is descent with inherited
   modification. This definition encompasses everything from small-scale
   evolution (for example, changes in the frequency of different gene
   versions in a population from one generation to the next) to
   large-scale evolution (for example, the descent of different species
   from a shared ancestor over many generations). evolution helps us to
   understand the living world around us, as well as its history.

The explanation

   Biological evolution is not simply a matter of change over time. Many
   things change over time: caterpillars turn into moths, trees lose and
   regrow their leaves, mountain ranges rise and erode, but they aren’t
   examples of biological evolution because they don’t involve descent
   with inherited modifications.

   All life on Earth shares a common ancestor, just as you and your
   cousins share a common grandmother. Through the process of descent with
   modification, this common ancestor gave rise to the diverse species
   that we see documented in the fossil record and around us today.
   evolution means that we’re all distant cousins: humans and oak trees,
   hummingbirds and whales.
   Above, a series of photos of the same tree throughout the four seasons,
   showing change over time. The tree on the left is barren (winter),
   left-middle is spring, right-middle is summer, and right is autumn.
   Below is a phylogeny showing a whale, a human, a bird, and a lizard
   with their common ancestor, the ancestral tetrapod. It is titled

Significance

   Modern evolutionary theory gives a detailed quantitative description of
   microevolutionary processes that occur within evolving populations of
   organisms, but evolutionary transitions and emergence of multiple
   levels of complexity remain poorly understood. Here, we establish the
   correspondence among the key features of evolution, learning dynamics,
   and renormalizability of physical theories to outline a theory of
   evolution that strives to incorporate all evolutionary processes within
   a unified mathematical framework of the theory of learning. According
   to this theory, for example, replication of genetic material and
   natural selection readily emerge from the learning dynamics, and in
   sufficiently complex systems, the same learning phenomena occur on
   multiple levels or on different scales, similar to the case of
   renormalizable physical theories.
   Keywords: theory of learning, loss function, natural selection, major
   evolutionary transitions, origin of life

Abstract

   We apply the theory of learning to physically renormalizable systems in
   an attempt to outline a theory of biological evolution, including the
   origin of life, as multilevel learning. We formulate seven fundamental
   principles of evolution that appear to be necessary and sufficient to
   render a universe observable and show that they entail the major
   features of biological evolution, including replication and natural
   selection. It is shown that these cornerstone phenomena of biology
   emerge from the fundamental features of learning dynamics such as the
   existence of a loss function, which is minimized during learning. We
   then sketch the theory of evolution using the mathematical framework of
   neural networks, which provides for detailed analysis of evolutionary
   phenomena. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed theoretical
   framework, we derive a generalized version of the Central Dogma of
   molecular biology by analyzing the flow of information during learning
   (back propagation) and predicting (forward propagation) the environment
   by evolving organisms. The more complex evolutionary phenomena, such as
   major transitions in evolution (in particular, the origin of life),
   have to be analyzed in the thermodynamic limit, which is described in
   detail in the paper by Vanchurin et al. [V. Vanchurin, Y. I. Wolf, E.
   V. Koonin, M. I. Katsnelson, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 119,
   10.1073/pnas.2120042119 (2022)].

   What is life? If this question is asked in the scientific rather than
   in the philosophical context, a satisfactory answer should assume the
   form of a theoretical model of the origin and evolution of complex
   systems that are identified with life (1). NASA has operationally
   defined life as follows: “Life is a self-sustaining chemical system
   capable of Darwinian evolution” (2, 3). Apart from the insistence on
   chemistry, long-term evolution that involves (random) mutation,
   diversification, and adaptation is, indeed, an intrinsic, essential
   feature of life that is not apparent in any other natural phenomena.
   The problem with this definition, however, is that natural (Darwinian)
   selection itself appears to be a complex rather than an elementary
   phenomenon (4). In all evolving organisms we are aware of, for natural
   selection to kick off and to sustain long-term evolution, an essential
   condition is replication of a complex digital information carrier (a
   DNA or RNA molecule). The replication fidelity must be sufficiently
   high to provide for the differential replication of emerging mutants
   and survival of the fittest ones (this replication fidelity level is
   often referred to as Eigen threshold) (5). In modern organisms,
   accurate replication is ensured by elaborate molecular machineries that
   include not only replication and repair enzymes but also, the entire
   metabolic network of the cell, which supplies energy and building
   blocks for replication. Thus, the origin of life is a typical
   chicken-and-egg problem (or catch-22); accurate replication is
   essential for evolution, but the mechanisms ensuring replication
   fidelity are themselves products of complex evolutionary processes (6,
   7).

   Because genome replication that underlies natural selection is itself a
   product of evolution, origin of life has to be explained outside of the
   traditional framework of evolutionary biology. Modern evolutionary
   theory, steeped in population genetics, gives a detailed and arguably,
   largely satisfactory account of microevolutionary processes: that is,
   evolution of allele frequencies in a population of organisms under
   selection and random genetic drift (8, 9). However, this theory has
   little to say about the actual history of life, especially the
   emergence of new levels of biological complexity, and nothing at all
   about the origin of life.

   The crucial feature of biological complexity is its hierarchical
   organization. Indeed, multilevel hierarchies permeate biology: from
   small molecules to macromolecules; from macromolecules to functional
   complexes, subcellular compartments, and cells; from unicellular
   organisms to communities, consortia, and multicellularity; from simple
   multicellular organisms to highly complex forms with differentiated
   tissues; and from organisms to communities and eventually, to
   eusociality and to complex biocenoses involved in biogeochemical
   processes on the planetary scale. All these distinct levels jointly
   constitute the hierarchical organization of the biosphere.
   Understanding the origin and evolution of this hierarchical complexity,
   arguably, is one of the principal goals of biology.

   In large part, evolution of the multilevel organization of biological
   systems appears to be driven by solving optimization problems, which
   entails conflicts or trade-offs between optimization criteria at
   different levels or scales, leading to frustrated states, in the
   language of physics (10–12). Two notable cases in point are
   parasite–host arms races that permeate biological evolution and makes
   major contributions to the diversity and complexity of life-forms
   (13–16) and multicellular organization of complex organisms, where the
   tendency of individual cells to reproduce at the highest possible rate
   is countered by the control of cell division imposed at the organismal
   level (17, 18).

   Two tightly linked but distinct fundamental concepts that lie
   effectively outside the canonical narrative of evolutionary biology
   address evolution of biological complexity: major transitions in
   evolution (MTEs) (19–21) and multilevel selection (MLS) (22–27). Each
   MTE involves the emergence of a new level of organization, often
   described as an evolutionary transition in individuality. A clear-cut
   example is the evolution of multicellularity, whereby a new level of
   selection emerges, namely selection among ensembles of cells rather
   than among individual cells. Multicellular life-forms (even counting
   only complex organisms with multiple cell types) evolved on many
   independent occasions during the evolution of life (28, 29), implying
   that emergence of new levels of complexity is a major evolutionary
   trend rather than a rare, chance event.

   The MLS remains a controversial concept, presumably because of the link
   to the long-debated subject of group selection (27, 30). However, as a
   defining component of MTE, MLS appears to be indispensable. A proposed
   general mechanism behind the MTE, formulated by analogy with the
   physical theory of the origin of patterns (for example, in glass-like
   systems), involves competing interactions at different levels and the
   frustrated states, such interactions cause (12). In the physical theory
   of spin glasses, frustrations result in nonergodicity and enable
   formation and persistence of long-term memory: that is, history (31,
   32). By contrast, ergodic systems have no true history because they
   reach all possible states during their evolution (at least in the large
   time limit), and thus, the only content of quasihistory of such systems
   is the transition from less probable to more probable states for purely
   combinatorial reasons: that is, entropy increase (33). As emphasized in
   Schroedinger’s seminal book (34), even if only in general terms, life
   is based on “negentropic” processes, and frustrations at different
   levels are necessary for these processes to take off and persist (12).

   The origin of cells, which can and probably should be equated with the
   origin of life, was the first and most momentous transition at the
   onset of biological evolution, and as such, it is outside the purview
   of evolutionary biology sensu stricto. Arguably, the theoretical
   investigation of the origin of life can be feasible only within the
   framework of an envelope theory that would incorporate biological
   evolution as a special case. It is natural to envisage such a theory as
   encompassing all nonergodic processes occurring in the universe, of
   which life is a special case, emerging under conditions that remain to
   be investigated and defined.

   Here, in pursuit of a maximally general theory of evolution, we adopt
   the formalism of the theory of machine learning (35). Importantly,
   learning here is perceived in the maximally general sense as an
   objective process that occurs in all evolving systems, including but
   not limited to biological ones (36). As such, the analogy between
   learning and selection appears obvious. Both types of processes involve
   trial and error and acceptance or rejection of the results based on
   some formal criteria; in other words, both are optimization processes
   (22, 37, 38). Here, we assess how far this analogy extends by
   establishing the correspondence between key features of biological
   evolution and concepts as well as the mathematical formalism of
   learning theory. We make the case that loss function, which is central
   to the learning theory, can be usefully and generally employed as the
   equivalent of the fitness function in the context of evolution. Our
   original motivation was to explain major features of biological
   evolution from more general principles of physics. However, after
   formulating such principles and embedding them within the mathematical
   framework of learning, we find that the theory can potentially apply to
   the entire history of the evolving universe (36), including physical
   processes that have been taking place since the big bang and chemical
   processes that directly antedated and set the stage for the origin of
   life. The central propositions of the evolution theory outlined here
   include both key physical principles (namely, hierarchy of scale,
   frequency gaps, and renormalizability) (39, 40) and major features of
   life (such as MLS, persistence of genetic parasites, and programmed
   cell death).

   We show that learning in a complex environment leads to separation of
   scales, with trainable variables splitting into at least two classes:
   faster- and slower-changing ones. Such separation of scales underlies
   all processes that involve the formation of complex structure in the
   universe from the scale of an atom to that of clusters of galaxies. We
   argue that, for the emergence of life, at least three temporal scales,
   which correspond to environmental, phenotypic, and genotypic variables,
   are essential. In evolving learning systems, the slowest-changing
   variables are digitized and acquire the replication capacity, resulting
   in differential reproduction depending on the loss (fitness) function
   value, which is necessary and sufficient for the onset of evolution by
   natural selection. Subsequent evolution of life involves emergence of
   many additional scales, which correspond to MTE. Hereafter, we use the
   term “evolution” to describe temporal changes of living and lifelike
   and prebiotic systems (organisms), whereas the more general term
   “dynamics” refers to temporal processes in other physical systems.

   At least since the publication of Schroedinger’s book, the possibility
   has been discussed that, although life certainly obeys the laws of
   physics, a different class of laws unique to biology could exist.
   Often, this putative physics of life is associated with emergence
   (41–43), but the nature of the involved emergent phenomena, to our
   knowledge, has not been clarified until very recently (36). Here, we
   outline a general approach to modeling and studying evolution as
   multilevel learning, supporting the view that a distinct type of
   physical theory, namely the theory of learning (35, 36), is necessary
   to investigate the evolution of complex objects in the universe, of
   which evolution of life is a specific, even if highly remarkable form.

1. Fundamental Principles of evolution

   In this section, we attempt to formulate the minimal universal
   principles that define an observable universe, in which evolution is
   possible and perhaps, inevitable. Our analysis started from the major
   features of biological evolution discussed in the next section and
   proceeded toward the general principles. However, we begin the
   discussion with the latter for the sake of transparency and generality.

   What are the requirements for a universe to be observable? The
   possibility to make meaningful observations implies a degree of order
   and complexity in the observed universe emerging from evolutionary
   processes, and such evolvability itself seems to be predicated on
   several fundamental principles. It has to be emphasized that
   “observation” and “learning” here by no means imply “mind” or
   “consciousness” but a far more basic requirement. To learn and survive
   in an environment, a system (or observer) must predict, with some
   minimal but sufficient degree of accuracy, the response of that
   environment to various actions and to be able to choose such actions
   that are compatible with the observer’s continued existence in that
   environment. In this sense, any life-form is an observer, and so are
   even inanimate systems endowed with the ability of feedback reaction.
   In this most general sense, observation is a prerequisite for
   evolution. We first formulate the basic principles underlying
   observability and evolvability and then, give the pertinent comments
   and explanations.
     * P1. Loss function. In any evolving system, there exists a loss
       function of time-dependent variables that is minimized during
       evolution.
     * P2. Hierarchy of scales. Evolving systems encompass multiple
       dynamical variables that change on different temporal scales (with
       different characteristic frequencies).
     * P3. Frequency gaps. Dynamical variables are split among distinct
       levels of organization separated by sufficiently wide frequency
       gaps.
     * P4. Renormalizability. Across the entire range of organization of
       evolving systems, a statistical description of faster-changing
       (higher-frequency) variables is feasible through the
       slower-changing (lower-frequency) variables.
     * P5. Extension. Evolving systems have the capacity to recruit
       additional variables that can be utilized to sustain the system and
       the ability to exclude variables that could destabilize the system.
     * P6. Replication. In evolving systems, replication and elimination
       of the corresponding information-processing units (IPUs) can take
       place on every level of organization.
     * P7. Information flow. In evolving systems, slower-changing levels
       absorb information from faster-changing levels during learning and
       pass information down to the faster levels for prediction of the
       state of the environment and the system itself.

   The first principle (P1) is of special importance as the starting point
   for a formal description of evolution as a learning process. The very
   existence of a loss function implies that the dynamical system of the
   universe or simpler, the universe itself is a learning (evolving)
   system (36). Effectively, here we assume that stability or survival of
   any subsystem of the universe is equivalent to solving an optimization
   or learning problem in the mathematical sense and that there is always
   something to learn. Crucially, for solving complex optimization
   problems dependent on many variables, the best and in fact, the only
   efficient method is selection implemented in various stochastic
   algorithms (Markov Chain Monte Carlo, stochastic gradient descent,
   genetic algorithms, and more). All evolution can be perceived as an
   implementation of a stochastic learning algorithm as well. Put another
   way, learning is optimization by trial and error, and so is evolution.

   The remaining principles P2 to P7 provide sufficient conditions for
   observers of our type (that is, complex life-forms) to evolve within a
   learning system. In particular, P2, P3, and P4 comprise the necessary
   conditions for observability of a universe by any observer, whereas P5,
   P6, and P7 represent the defining conditions for the origin of life of
   our type (hereafter, we omit the qualification for brevity). More
   precisely, P2 and P3 provide for the possibility of at least a simple
   form of learning of the environment (fast-changing variables) by an
   observer (slow-changing variables) and hence, the emergence of complex
   organization of the slow-changing variables. P4 corresponds to the
   physical concept of renormalizability, or renormalization group (39,
   40), whereby the same macroscopic equations, albeit with different
   parameters, govern processes at different levels or scales, thus
   limiting the number of relevant variables, constraining the complexity,
   and allowing for a coarse-grained description. This principle ensures a
   renormalizable universe capable of evolution and amenable to
   observation. Together, P2 to P4 define a universe, in which partial or
   approximate knowledge of the environment (in other words, coarse
   graining) is both attainable and useful for the survival of evolving
   systems (observers). In a universe where P4 does not apply (that is,
   one with nonrenormalizable physical laws), what happens at the
   macroscopic level will critically depend on the details of the
   processes at the microlevel. In a universe where P2 and P3 do not
   apply, the separation of the micro- and macrolevels itself would not be
   apparent. In such a universe, it would be impossible to survive without
   first discovering fundamental physical laws, whereas living organisms
   on our planet have evolved for billions of years before starting to
   study quantum physics.

   Principles P5, P6, and P7 endow evolving systems with the access to
   more advanced algorithms for learning and predicting the environment,
   paving the way for the evolution of complex systems, including
   eventually, life. These principles jointly underlie the emergence of
   the crucial phenomenon of selection (44, 45). In its simplest form,
   selection is for stability and persistence of evolving, learning
   systems (46). Learning and survival are tightly linked because survival
   is predicated on the system’s ability to extract information from the
   environment, and this ability depends on the stability of the system on
   timescales required for learning. Roughly, a system cannot survive in a
   world where the properties of the environment change faster than the
   evolving system can learn them. According to P5, evolving systems
   consume resources (such as food), which themselves could be produced by
   other evolving systems, to be utilized as building blocks and energy
   sources, which are required for learning. This principle embodies
   Schroedinger’s vision that “organisms feed on negentropy” (34). Under
   P6, replication of the carriers of slowly changing variables becomes
   the basis of long-term persistence and memory in evolving systems. This
   principle can be viewed as a learning algorithm built on P3, whereby
   the timescales characteristic of an individual organism and of
   consecutive generations are separated. This principle excludes from
   consideration certain imaginary forms of life: for example, Stanislav
   Lem’s famous Solaris (47). Finally, P7 describes how information flows
   between different levels in the multilevel learning, giving rise to a
   generalized Central Dogma of molecular biology, which is discussed in
   Generalized Central Dogma of Molecular Biology.

2. Fundamental evolutionary Phenomena

   In this section, we link the fundamental principles of evolution P1 to
   P7 formulated above to the basic phenomenological features of life (E1
   to E10) and seek equivalencies in the theory of learning. The list
   below is organized by first formulating a biological feature, and then,
   it is organized by 1) tracing the connections to the fundamental
   principles and 2) adding more general comments.

E1. IPUs.

   Discrete IPUs (that is, self- vs. nonself-differentiation and
   discrimination) exist at all levels of organization. All biological
   systems at all levels of organization, such as genes, cells, organisms,
   populations, and so on up to the level of the entire biosphere, possess
   some degree of self-coherence that separates them, first and foremost,
   from the environment at large and from other similar-level IPUs.
     * 1)
       The existence of IPUs is predicated on the fundamental principles
       P1 to P4. The wide range of temporal scales (P2) in dynamical
       systems and gaps between the scales (P3) naturally enable the
       separation of slower- and faster-changing components. In
       particular, renormalizability (P4) applies to the hierarchy of
       IPUs. The statistical predictability of the higher frequencies
       allows the IPUs to decrease the loss function of the lower
       frequencies, despite the much slower reaction times.
     * 2)
       Separation of (relatively) slow-changing prebiological IPUs from
       the (typically) fast-changing environment kicked off the most
       primitive form of prebiological selection: selection for stability
       and persistence (survivor bias). More stable, slower-changing IPUs
       win in the competition and accumulate over time, increasing the
       separation along the temporal axis as the boundary between the IPUs
       and the environment grows sharper. Additional key phenomena, such
       as utilization of available environmental resources (P5) and the
       stimulus–response mode of information exchange (P7), stem from the
       flow of matter and information across this boundary and the ensuing
       separation of internal and external physicochemical processes.
       Increasing self- vs. nonself-differentiation, combined with
       replication of the carriers of slow-changing variables (P6), sets
       the stage for competition between evolving entities and for the
       onset of the ultimate evolutionary phenomenon, natural selection
       (E6).

E2. Frustration.

   All complex, dynamical systems face multidimensional and multiscale
   optimization problems, which generically lead to frustration resulting
   from conflicting objectives at different scales. This is a key,
   intrinsic feature of all such systems and a major force driving the
   advent of increasing multilevel complexity (12). Frustration is an
   extremely general physical phenomenon that is by no account limited to
   biology but rather, occurs already in much simpler physical systems,
   such as spin and structural glasses, the behavior of which is
   determined by competing interactions so that a degree of complexity is
   attained (31, 32).
     * 1)
       The multiscale organization of the universe (P2) provides the
       physical foundation for the ubiquity of frustrated states that
       typically arises whenever there is a conflict (trade-off) between
       short- and long-range optimization problems. Frustrated
       interactions yield multiwell potential landscapes, in which no
       single state is substantially fitter than numerous other local
       optima. Multiparameter and multiscale optimization of the loss
       function on such a landscape involves nonergodic
       (history-dependent) dynamics, which is characteristic of complex
       systems.
     * 2)
       IPUs face conflicting interactions starting from the most primitive
       prebiological state (12). Indeed, the separation of any system from
       the environment immediately results in the conflict of
       permeability; a stronger separation enhances the self- vs.
       nonself-differentiation and thus, increases the stability of the
       system, but it compromises information and matter exchange with the
       environment, limiting the potential for growth. In biology,
       virtually all aspects of the organismal architecture and operation
       are subject to such frustrations or trade-offs: the conflict
       between the fidelity and speed of information transmission at all
       levels, between specialization and generalism, between the
       individual- and population-level benefits, and more. The ubiquity
       of frustrations and the fundamental impossibility of their
       resolution in a universally optimal manner are perpetual drivers of
       evolution and give rise to evolutionary transitions, attaining
       otherwise unreachable levels of complexity.

   There are two distinct types of frustrations, spatial and temporal.
   Spatial frustration is similar to the frustration that is commonly
   analyzed in condensed matter systems, such as spin glasses (31, 32). In
   this case, the spatially local and nonlocal interacting terms have
   opposite signs so that the equilibrium state is determined by the
   balance between the terms. In neural networks, a neuron (like a single
   spin) might have a local objective (such as binary classification of
   incoming signals) but is also a part of a neural network (like a spin
   network), which has its own global objective (such as predicting its
   boundary conditions). For a particular neuron, optimization of the
   local objective can conflict with the global objective, causing spatial
   frustration. Temporal frustration emerges because in the context of
   multilevel learning, the same neuron becomes a part of higher-level
   IPUs that operate at different temporal scales (frequencies). Then, the
   optimal state of the neuron with respect to an IPU operating at a given
   timescale can differ from the optimal state of the same neuron with
   respect to another IPU operating at a different timescale (36).
   Similarly to the spatial frustrations, temporal frustrations cannot be
   completely resolved, but an optimal balance between different spatial
   and temporal scales is achievable and represents a local equilibrium of
   the learning system.

E3. Multilevel Hierarchy.

   The hierarchy of multiple levels of organization is an intrinsic,
   essential feature of evolving biological systems in terms of both the
   structure of these systems (genes, genomes, cells, organisms, kin
   groups, populations, species, communities, and more) and the substrate
   the evolutionary forces act upon.
     * 1)
       Renormalizability of the universe (P4) implies that there is no
       inherently preferred level of organization, for which everything
       above and below would behave as a homogenous ensemble. Even if some
       levels of organization come into existence before others (for
       example, organisms before genes or unicellular organisms before
       multicellular ones), the other levels will necessarily emerge and
       consolidate subsequently.
     * 2)
       The hierarchy of the structural organization of biological systems
       was apparent to scholars from the earliest days of science.
       However, MLS was and remains a controversial subject in
       evolutionary biology (23, 26, 27). Intuitively and as implied by
       the Price equation (48), MLS should emerge in all evolving systems
       as long as the higher-level agency of selection possesses a
       sufficient degree of self- vs. nonself-differentiation. In
       particular, if organisms of a given species form populations that
       are sufficiently distinct genetically and interact competitively,
       population-level selection will ensue. evolution of biological
       systems is driven by conflicting interactions (E2) that tend to
       lead to ever-increasing complexity (12). This trend further feeds
       the propensity of these systems to form new levels of organization
       and is associated with evolutionary transitions that involve the
       advent of new units of selection at multiple levels of complexity.
       Thus, E3 can be considered a major consequence of E2.

E4. Near Optimality.

   Stochastic optimization or the use of stochastic optimization
   algorithms is the only feasible approach to complex optimization, but
   it guarantees neither finding the globally optimal solution nor
   retention of the optimal configuration when and if it is found. Rather,
   stochastic optimization tends to rapidly find local optima and keeps
   the system in their vicinity, sustaining the value of the loss function
   at a near-optimal level.
     * 1)
       According to P1, the dynamics of a learning (that is,
       self-optimizing) system is defined by a loss function (35, 36).
       When there is a steep gradient in the loss function, a system
       undergoing stochastic optimization rapidly descends in the right
       direction. However, because of frustrations that inevitably arise
       from interactions in a complex system, actual local peaks on the
       landscape are rarely reached, and the global peak is effectively
       unreachable. Learning systems tend to get stalled near local saddle
       points where changes along most of the dimensions either lead “up”
       or are “flat” in terms of the loss function, with only a small
       minority of the available moves decreasing the loss function (49).
     * 2)
       The extant biological systems (cells, multicellular organisms, and
       higher-level entities, such as populations and communities) are
       products of about 4 billion y of the evolution of life, and as
       such, they are highly, albeit not completely, optimized. As a
       consequence, the typical distribution of the effects of heritable
       changes in biological evolution comprises numerous deleterious
       changes, comparatively rare beneficial changes and common neutral
       changes, and those with fitness effects below the noise level (50).
       The preponderance of neutral and slightly deleterious changes
       provides for evolution by genetic drift whereby a population moves
       on the same level or even slightly downward on the fitness
       landscape, potentially reaching another region of the landscape
       where beneficial mutations are available (51, 52).

E5. Diversity of Near-Optimal Solutions.

   Solutions on the loss function landscapes that arise in complex
   optimization problems span numerous local peaks of comparable heights.
     * 1)
       The existence of multiple peaks of comparable heights in the loss
       function landscapes is a fundamental physical property of
       frustrated systems (E2), whereas the pervasiveness of frustration
       itself is a consequence of the multiscale and multilevel
       organization of the universe (P2). Frustrated dynamical systems are
       nonergodic, which from the biological perspective, means that, once
       separated, evolutionary trajectories diverge rather than converge.
       Because most of these trajectories traverse parts of the genotype
       space with comparable fitness values, competition rarely results in
       complete dominance of one lineage over the others but rather,
       generates rich diversity.
     * 2)
       In terms of evolutionary biology, fitness landscapes are rugged,
       with multiple adaptive peaks of comparable fitness (53, 54), and a
       salient trend during evolution is the spread of life-forms across
       multiple peaks as opposed to concentrating on one or few. evolution
       pushes evolving organisms to explore and occupy all available
       niches and try all possible strategies. In the context of machine
       learning, identical neural networks can start from the same initial
       state but for example, under the stochastic gradient descent
       algorithm, would generically evolve toward different local minima.
       Thus, the diversity of solutions is a generic property of learning
       systems. More technically, the diversification is due to the
       entropy production through the dynamics of the neutral trainable
       variables (see the next section).

E6. Separation of Phenotype from Genotype.

   This quintessential feature of life embodies two distinct (albeit
   inseparable in known organisms) symmetry-breaking phenomena: 1)
   separation between dedicated digital information storage media (stable,
   rarely updatable, tending to distributions with discrete values) and
   mostly analog processing devices and 2) asymmetry of the information
   flow within the IPUs whereby the genotype provides “instructions” for
   the phenotype, whereas the phenotype largely loses the ability to
   update the genotype directly. The separation between the information
   storage and processing subsystems is a prerequisite for efficient
   evolution that probably emerged early on the path from prebiotic
   entities to the emergence of life.
     * 1)
       The separation between phenotype and genotype extends the scale
       separation on the intra-IPU level as follows from the fundamental
       principles P1 to P4. Intermediate-frequency components of an IPU
       (phenotype) buffer the slowest components from direct interaction
       with the environment (the highest-frequency variables), further
       increasing the stability of the slowest components and making them
       suitable for long-term information storage. As the temporal scales
       separate further, the interactions between them change. Asymmetric
       information flow (P7) stabilizes the system, enabling long-term
       preservation of information (genotype) while retaining the reactive
       flexibility of the faster-changing components (phenotype).
     * 2)
       The emergence of the separation between phenotype and genotype is a
       crucial event in prebiotic evolution. This separation is prominent
       in all known as well as hypothetical life-forms. Even when the
       phenotype and genotype roles are fulfilled by chemically identical
       molecules, as in the RNA world scenario of primordial evolution
       (55, 56), their roles as effectors and information storage devices
       are sharply distinct. In biological terms, the split is between
       replicators (that is, the digital information carriers [genomes])
       and reproducers (57–59), the analog devices (cells, organisms) that
       host the replicators, supply them with building blocks (P5), and
       themselves reproduce (P6) under the replicators’ instruction (P7).
       Although the genotype/phenotype separation is a major staple of
       life, it is in itself insufficient to qualify an IPU as a life-form
       (computers and record players, in which the separation between
       information storage and operational parts is prominent and
       essential, clearly are not life, even though invented by advanced
       organisms). The asymmetry of information flow between genotype and
       phenotype (P7) is the most general form of the phenomenon known as
       the Central Dogma of molecular biology: the unidirectional flow of
       information from nucleic acids to proteins as originally formulated
       by Crick (60). This asymmetry is also prominent in other
       information-processing systems, in particular computers. Indeed,
       von Neumann architecture computers have inherently distinct memory
       and processing units, with the instruction flow from the former to
       the latter (61, 62). It appears that any advanced
       information-processing systems are endowed with this property.

E7. Replication.

   Emergence of long-term digital storage devices, that is genomes
   consisting of RNA or DNA (E6) provides for long-term information
   preservation, facilitates adaptive reactions to changes in the
   environment, and promotes the stability of IPUs to the point where (at
   least in chemical systems) it is limited by the energy of the chemical
   bonds rather than the energy of thermal fluctuations. Obviously,
   however, as long as this information is confined to a single IPU, it
   will disappear with the inevitable eventual destruction of that IPU.
   Should this be the case, other IPUs of similar architecture would need
   to accumulate a comparable amount of information from scratch to reach
   the same level of stability. Thus, copying and sharing information are
   essential for long-term (effectively, indefinite) persistence of IPUs.
     * 1)
       The fundamental principle P6 postulates the existence of mechanisms
       for information copying and elimination. If genomic information can
       be replicated, even most primitive sharing mechanisms (such as
       physical splitting of an IPU under forces of surface tension) would
       result (even if not reliably) in the emergence of distinct IPUs
       preloaded with information that was amassed by their progenitor(s).
       This process short circuits learning and allows the information to
       accumulate at timescales far exceeding the characteristic lifetimes
       of individual IPUs.
     * 2)
       Information copying and sharing are beneficial only if the fidelity
       exceeds a certain threshold, sometimes called Eigen limit in
       evolutionary biology (5–7). Nevertheless, in primitive prebiotic
       systems, the required fidelity level could have been quite low
       (63). For instance, even a biased chemical composition of a
       hydrophobic droplet could enhance the stability of the descendant
       droplets and thus, endow them with an advantage in the selection
       for persistence. However, once relatively sophisticated mechanisms
       of information copying and sharing emerge or more precisely, when
       replicators become information storage devices, the overall
       stability of the system can increase by orders of magnitude. To wit
       and astonishingly, the only biosphere known to us represents an
       unbroken chain of genetic information transmission that spans about
       4 billion y, commensurate with the stellar evolution scale.

E8. Natural Selection.

   evolution by natural selection (Darwinian evolution) arises from the
   combination of all the principles and phenomena described above. The
   necessary and sufficient conditions for Darwinian evolution to operate
   are 1) the existence of IPUs that are distinct from the environment and
   from each other (E1), 2) the dependence of the stability of an IPU on
   the information it contains (that is, the phenotype–genotype feedback;
   E6), and 3) the ability of IPUs to make copies of embedded information
   and share it with other IPUs (E7). When these three conditions are met,
   the relative frequencies of the more stable IPUs will increase with
   time via attrition of the less stable ones (survival of the fittest)
   and transfer of information among IPUs, both vertically (to progeny)
   and horizontally. This process engenders the key feature of Darwinian
   evolution, differential reproduction of genotypes, based on the
   feedback from the environment transmitted through the phenotype.
     * 1)
       All seven fundamental principles of life-compatible universes (P1
       to P7) are involved in enabling evolution by natural selection. The
       very existence of units, on which selection can operate, hinges on
       self- vs. nonself-discrimination of prebiotic IPUs (E1) and the
       emergence of shareable information storage (E6 and E7). The crucial
       step to biology is the emergence of the link between the loss
       function (P1), on the one hand, and the existence of the IPUs (P2,
       P3, P4, and E1), on the other hand. Consumption of (limited)
       external resources (P5) entails competition between IPUs that share
       the same environment and turns mere shifts of the relative
       frequencies into true “survival of the fittest.” The ability of the
       IPUs to replicate (P6) and expand their memory storage (genotype;
       P7, E6, and E7) provides them with access to hitherto unavailable
       degrees of freedom, making evolution an open-ended process rather
       than a quick, limited search for a local optimum.
     * 2)
       evolution by natural selection is the central tenet of evolutionary
       biology and a key part of the NASA definition of life. An important
       note on definitions is due. We already referred to selection when
       discussing prebiotic evolution (E1); however, the term “natural
       (Darwinian) selection” is here reserved for the efficient form of
       selection that emerges with the replication of dedicated
       information storage devices (P6 and E6). Differential reproduction,
       whereby the environment provides feedback on the fitness of
       genotypes while acting on phenotypes, turns into Darwinian survival
       of the fittest in the presence of competition. When IPUs depend on
       environmental resources, such competition inevitably arises, except
       in the unrealistic case of unlimited supply (44). With the onset of
       Darwinian evolution, the system can be considered to cross the
       threshold from prelife to life (64, 65). The evolutionary process
       is naturally represented by movement of an evolving IPU in a
       genotype space, where proximity is defined by similarity between
       distinct genotypes and transitions correspond to elementary
       evolutionary events: that is, mutations in the most general sense
       (66). For any given environment, fitness—that is, a measure of the
       ability of a genotype to produce viable offspring—can be defined
       for each point in the genotype space, forming a multidimensional
       fitness landscape (53, 54). Selection creates a bias for
       preferential fixation of mutations that increase fitness, even if
       the mutations themselves occur completely randomly.

E9. Parasitism.

   Parasites and host–parasite coevolution are ubiquitous across
   biological systems at multiple levels of organization and are both
   intrinsic to and indispensable for the evolution of life.
     * 1)
       Due to the flexibility of life-compatible systems (P5 and P6) and
       the symmetry breaking in the information flow (P7) combined with
       the inherent tendency of life to diversify (E5), parts of the
       system inevitably settle on a parasitic state: that is, scavenging
       information and matter from the host without making a positive
       contribution to its fitness.
     * 2)
       From the biological perspective, parasites evolve to minimize their
       direct interface with the environment and conversely, maximize
       their interaction with the host; in other words, the host replaces
       most of the environment for the parasite. Parasites inevitably
       emerge and persist in biological systems because of two reasons. 1)
       The parasitic state is reachable via an entropy-increasing step and
       therefore, is highly probable (16), and 2) highly efficient
       antiparasite immunity is costly (67). The cost of immunity reflects
       another universal trade-off analogous to the trade-off between
       information transfer fidelity and energy expenditure; in both
       cases, an infinite amount of energy is required to reach a zero
       error rate or a parasite-free state. From a complementary
       standpoint, parasites inevitably evolve as cheaters in the game of
       life that exploit the host as a resource, without expending energy
       on resource production. Short-term, parasites reduce the host
       fitness by both direct drain on its resources and various indirect
       effects, including the cost of defense. However, in a longer-term
       perspective, parasites make up a reservoir for recruitment of new
       functions (especially, but far from exclusively, for defense) by
       the hosts (14, 15). The host–parasite relationship can evolve
       toward transition to a mutually beneficial, symbiotic lifestyle
       that can further progress to mutualism and in some cases, complete
       integration as exemplified by the origin of essential endosymbiotic
       organelles in eukaryotes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (68, 69).
       Parasites emerge at similar levels of biological organization
       (organisms parasitizing other organisms) or across levels (genetic
       elements parasitizing organismal genomes or cell clones
       parasitizing multicellular organisms).

E10. Programmed Death.

   Programmed (to various degrees) death is an intrinsic feature of life.
     * 1)
       Replication and elimination of IPUs (P6) and utilization of
       additional degrees of freedom (P5) form the foundation for the
       phenomenon of programmed death. At some levels of organization (for
       example, intragenomic), the ability to add and eliminate units
       (such as genes) for the benefit of the higher-level systems (such
       as organisms) provides an obvious path of optimization. Elimination
       of units could be, in principle, completely random, but selection
       (E8) generates a sufficiently strong feedback to facilitate and
       structure the loss process (for example, purging low-fitness genes
       via homologous recombination or altruistic suicide of infected or
       otherwise impaired cells). The same forces operate at least at the
       cell level and conceivably, at all levels of organization and
       selection (P4). In particular, if population-level or kin-level
       selection is sufficiently strong, mechanisms for altruistic death
       of individual organisms apparently can be fixed in evolution (70,
       71).
     * 2)
       Programmed death is a prominent case of minimization of the
       higher-level (for example, organismal) loss function at the cost of
       increasing the lower-level loss function (such as that of
       individual cells). Although (tightly controlled) programmed cell
       death was originally discovered in multicellular organisms and has
       been thought to be limited to these complex life-forms, altruistic
       cell suicide now appears to be a universal biological phenomenon
       (71–73).

   To conclude this section, which we titled “fundamental evolutionary
   phenomena,” deliberately omitting “biological,” it seems important to
   note that phenomena E1 to E7 are generic, applying to all learning
   systems, including purely physical and prebiotic ones. However, the
   onset of natural selection (E8) marks the origin of life, so that the
   phenomena E8 to E10 belong in the realm of biology.

3. Optimization and Scale Separation in Evolving Systems

   In the previous sections, we formulated the seven fundamental
   principles of evolution P1 to P7 and then, argued that the key
   evolutionary phenomena E1 to E10 can be interpreted and analyzed in the
   context of these principles and apparently, derived from the latter.
   The next step is to formulate a mathematical framework that would be
   consistent with the fundamental principles and thus, would allow us to
   model evolutionary phenomena analytically or numerically. For
   concreteness, the proposed framework is based on a mathematical model
   of artificial neural networks (74, 75), but we first outline a general
   optimization approach in a form suitable for modeling biological
   evolution.

   We are interested in the broadest class of optimization problems, where
   the loss (or cost) function

   are the fastest changing among the trainable variables because
   fluctuations resulting in their change are, in general, fully
   stochastic. On the other end of the spectrum of variables, even minor
   changes to the effectively constant variables
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;c<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo

   compromise the entire learning (evolution) process: that is, result in
   a substantial increase of the loss function value; these variables
   correspond to deep minima of the loss function. When the basin of
   attraction of a minimum is deep and narrow, the system stays in its
   bottom for a long time, and then, to describe such a state, it is
   sufficient to use discrete information (that is, to indicate that the
   system stays in a given minimum) rather than to list all specific
   values of the coordinates in a multidimensional space.

   In a generic optimization problem, the dynamics of both trainable and
   nontrainable variables involves a broad distribution of characteristic
   timescales
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   , and switching between scales is equivalent to switching between
   different frequencies or in the context of biological evolution,
   between different levels of organization. For any fixed
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   , all variables can be partitioned into three classes depending on how
   fast they change with respect to the specified timescale:
     * fast-changing nontrainable variables that characterize an organism
       [MATH: <lt;mo>gt; <lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mo>gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi
       mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo stretchy="true">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi
       mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;o<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
       stretchy="true">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;mo>gt;)<lt;/mo>gt; :MATH]
       and its environment
       [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
       stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;e<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
       stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
       and change on timescales
       [MATH: <lt;mo>gt;≪<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
       ;
     * intermediate-changing adaptable variables
       [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
       stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;a<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
       stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
       or neutral directions
       [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
       stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;n<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
       stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
       that change on timescales ~
       [MATH: <lt;mi>gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
       ; and
     * slow-changing variables, which are the degrees of freedom
       [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
       stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;c<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
       stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
       that have already been well trained and are effectively constant
       (at or near equilibrium), only changing on timescales
       [MATH: <lt;mo>gt;≫<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
       .

   As will become evident shortly, the separation of these three classes
   of variables and interactions between them are central to the evolution
   and selection on all levels of organization, resulting in pervasive
   multilevel learning and selection.

   Depending on the considered timescale
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   (or as a result of environmental changes), the same dynamical degree of
   freedom can be assigned to different classes of variables: that is,
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;o<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   ,
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;e<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   ,
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;c<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   ,
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;a<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   , or
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;n<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   . For example, on the shortest timescale, which corresponds to the
   lifetime of an individual organism (one generation), the adaptable
   variables are the phenotypic traits that quickly respond to
   environmental changes, whereas the slowest, near-constant variables are
   the genomic sequences (genotype) that change minimally if at all. On
   longer timescales, corresponding to thousands or millions of
   generations, fast-evolving portions of the genome become adaptable
   variables, whereas the conserved core of the genome remains in the
   near-constant class (50). Analogously, the neutral directions
   correspond either to nonconsequential phenotypic changes or to neutral
   genomic mutations, depending on the timescale. It is well known that
   the overwhelming majority of the mutations are either deleterious and
   therefore, eliminated by purifying selection or (nearly) neutral and
   thus, can be either lost or fixed via drift (76, 77). However, when the
   environment changes or under the influence of other mutations, some of
   the neutral mutations can become beneficial [a genetic phenomenon known
   as epistasis, which is pervasive in evolution (78, 79)], and in their
   entirety, neutral mutations form the essential reservoir of variation
   available for adaptive evolution (80). Even which variables are
   classified as nontrainable
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi
   mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   depends on the timescale
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   . For example, if a learning system was trained for a sufficiently long
   time, some of the trainable variables
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;a<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   or
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;n<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   might have already equilibrated and become nontrainable.

4. The Neural Network Framework

   Now that we described an optimization problem that is suitable for
   modeling evolution of organisms (or populations of organisms), we can
   construct a mathematical framework to solve such optimization problems.
   For this purpose, we employ a mathematical theory of artificial neural
   networks (74, 75), which is simple enough to perform calculations while
   being consistent with all of the fundamental principles (P1 to P7), and
   thus, it can be used for modeling evolutionary phenomena (E1 to E10).
   We first recall a general framework of the neural network theory.

   Consider a learning system represented as a neural network, with the
   state vector described by trainable variables
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   (which describe a collective notation for weight matrix
   [MATH: <lt;mover accent="true">gt;<lt;mi>gt;w<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo>gt;^<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mover>gt; :MATH]
   and bias vector
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;b<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   ) and nontrainable variables
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   (which describe the current state vector of individual neurons). In the
   biological context,
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   collectively represent the current state of the organism
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;o<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   and of its environment
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;e<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   , and
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   determines how
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   changes with time, in particular, how the organism reacts to
   environmental challenges. The nontrainable variables are modeled as
   changing in discrete time steps
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msub>gt;<lt;mtext>gt;x<lt;/mtext>gt;<lt;mi>gt;i<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;/msub>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo

   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mo>gt;+<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;msub>gt;<lt;mi>gt;b<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mi>gt;i<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;/msub>gt;<lt;/mro

   ’s are some nonlinear activation functions (for example, hyperbolic
   tangent or rectifier activation functions). The trainable variables are
   modeled as changing according to the gradient descent (or stochastic
   gradient descent) algorithm

   [4.2]

   where
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;γ<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   is the learning rate parameter and
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mi>gt;H<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi
   mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo>gt;,<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo

   is a suitably defined loss function (Eqs. 4.3 and 4.4). In other words,
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   are “gross” or “main” variables, which determine the rules of dynamics,
   and the dynamics of all other variables
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   is governed by these rules, per Eq. 4.1. In the biological context, Eq.
   4.1 represents fast, often stochastic environmental changes and the
   corresponding fast reaction of organisms at the phenotype level,
   whereas [4.2] reflects slower-learning dynamics of evolutionary
   adaptation via changes in the intermediate, adaptable variables: that
   is, the variable portion of the genome. The main learning objective is
   to adjust the trainable variables such that the average loss function
   is minimized subject to boundary conditions (also known as the training
   dataset), which in our case, is modeled as a time sequence of the
   environmental variables.

   For example, on a single-generation timescale, the fast-changing
   variables represent the environment
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;e<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   and nontrainable variables associated with organisms
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;o<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   , the intermediate-changing variables represent adaptive
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;a<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   and neutral
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;n<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]

   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   represent the genotype (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).

   The temporal-scale separation in biology is readily apparent in all
   organisms. Indeed, consequential changes in the environment
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;e<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   often occur on the scale of milliseconds to seconds, triggering
   physical changes within organisms

   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;o<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   at matching timescales. In response, individual organisms respond with
   phenotypic changes both adaptive
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;a<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   and neutral

   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   on the scale of minutes to hours, exploiting their genetically encoded
   phenotypic plasticity. A paradigmatic example is induction of bacterial
   operons in response to a change in the chemical composition of the
   environment, such as the switch from glucose to galactose as the
   primary nutrient (81, 82). In contrast, changes in the genome
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold-italic">gt;c<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   take much longer. Mutations typically occur at rates of about 1 to 10
   per genome replication cycle (83), which for unicellular organisms, is
   the same as a generation comprising from about an hour to hundreds or
   even thousands of hours. However, fixation of mutations, which
   represents an evolutionarily stable change at the genome level,
   typically takes many generations and thus, always occurs orders of
   magnitude slower than phenotype changes. Accordingly, on this
   timescale, any changes in the genome represent the third layer in the
   network, the slowly changing variables.

   To specify a microscopic loss function that would be appropriate for
   describing evolution and thus, give a specific form to the fundamental
   principle P1, we first note that adaptation to the environment is more
   efficient (that is, the loss function value is smaller) for a learning
   system, such as an organism, that can predict the state of its
   environment with a smaller error. Then, the relevant quantity is the
   so-called “boundary” loss function defined as the sum of squared
   errors,

   where the summation is taken only over the boundary (or environmental)
   nontrainable variables. It is helpful to think of the boundary loss
   function as the mismatch between the actual state of the environment
   and the state that would be predicted by the neural network if the
   environmental dynamics was switched off. In neuroscience, boundary loss
   is closely related to the surprise (or prediction error) associated
   with predictions of sensations, which depend on an internal model of
   the environment (84). In machine learning, boundary loss functions are
   most often used in the context of supervised learning (35), and in
   biological evolution, the “supervision” comes from the environment,
   which the evolving system, such as an organism or a population, is
   learning to predict.

   Another possibility for a learning system is to search for the minimum
   of the “bulk” loss function, which is defined as the sum of squared
   errors over all neurons:

   In the context of biological evolution, Malthusian fitness

   an evolving population (85). However, in the context of the theory of
   learning, the loss function must be identified with additive fitness:
   that is,

   [4.6]

   For a microscopic description of learning, the proportionality constant
   is unimportant, but as we argue in detail in the accompanying paper
   (86), in the description of the evolutionary process from the point of
   view of thermodynamics,
   [MATH: <lt;mi>gt;T<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   plays the role of “evolutionary temperature.”

   Given a concrete mathematical model of neural networks, one might
   wonder if all fundamental principles of evolution (P1 to P7) can be
   derived from this model. Such derivation would comprise additional
   evidence supporting the claim that the entire universe can be
   adequately described as a neural network (36). Clearly, the existence
   of a loss function (P1) follows automatically because learning of any
   neural network is always described relative to a specified loss
   function (Eq. 4.4 or 4.5). The other six principles also seem to
   naturally emerge from the learning dynamics of neural networks. In
   particular, the hierarchy of scales (P2) and frequency gaps (P3) are
   generic consequences of the learning dynamics, whereby a system that
   involves a wide range of variables changing at different rates is
   attracted toward a self-organized critical state of slow-changing
   trainable variables (87). Additional gaps between levels of
   organization are also expected to appear through phase transitions as
   becomes apparent in the thermodynamic description of evolution we
   develop in the accompanying paper (86). Renormalizability (P4) is a
   direct consequence of the second law of learning (35), according to
   which entropy of a system (and consequently, complexity of neural
   network or rank of its weight matrix) decreases with learning. This
   phenomenon was observed in neural network simulations (35) and is the
   exact type of dynamics that can make the system renormalizable even if
   it started off as a highly entangled (large rank of weight matrix),
   nonrenormalizable neural network. The extension (P5) and replication
   (P6) principles simply indicate that additional variables can lead to
   either increase or decrease in the value of the loss function (35). It
   is also important to note that in neural networks, an additional
   computational advantage (“quantum advantage”) can be achieved if the
   number of IPUs can vary (88). Therefore, to achieve such an advantage,
   a system must learn how to replicate and eliminate its IPUs (P6).
   Finally, in Generalized Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, we
   illustrate how Fourier transform (or more generally, wavelet transform)
   of the environmental degrees of freedom can be used for learning the
   environment and how the inverse transform can be used for predicting
   it. Thus, to be able to predict the environment (and hence, to be
   competitive), any evolving system must learn the mechanism behind such
   asymmetric information flow (P7).

5. Multilevel Learning

   In the previous sections, we argued that the learning process naturally
   divides all the dynamical variables into three distinct classes:
   fast-changing ones,

   stretchy="true">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   ; intermediate-changing ones,
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="true">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi>gt;a<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="true">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]

   stretchy="true">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   (

   stretchy="true">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   ); and slow-changing ones,
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="true">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi>gt;c<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="true">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Evidently, this separation of variables depends
   on the timescale
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   during which the system is observed, and variables migrate between
   classes when
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   is increased or decreased (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). The longer the time,
   the more variables reach equilibrium and therefore, can be modeled as
   nontrainable and fast changing,
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="true">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi>gt;e<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="true">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   , and the fewer variables remain slowly varying and can be modeled as
   effectively constant
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="true">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi>gt;c<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="true">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   . In other words, many variables that are nearly constant at short
   timescales migrate to the intermediate class at longer timescales,
   whereas variables from the intermediate class migrate to the fast
   class.

   In biological terms, if we consider learning dynamics on the timescale
   of one generation, then
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo>gt; <lt;/mo>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi
   mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo

   represent phenotype variables, and

   stretchy="true">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi>gt;c<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="true">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   represents genotype variables; however, on much longer timescales of
   multiple generations, the learning dynamics of populations (or
   communities) of organisms becomes relevant. On such timescales, the
   genotype variables acquire dynamics, with purifying and positive
   selection getting into play, whereas the phenotype variables
   progressively equilibrate. There is a clear connection between learning
   dynamics, including that in biological systems, and renormalizability
   of physical theories (P4). Indeed, from the point of view of an
   efficient learning algorithm, the parameters controlling learning
   dynamics, such as effective learning (or information-processing) rate
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;γ<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   , can vary from one timescale to another (for example, from individual
   organisms to populations or communities of organisms), but the general
   principles as well as specific dependencies captured in the equations
   above that govern the learning dynamics on different timescales remain
   the same. We refer to this universality of the learning process on
   different timescales and partitioning of the variables into temporal
   classes as multilevel learning.

   More precisely, multilevel learning is a property of learning systems,
   which allows for the basic equations of learning, such as [4.4], to
   remain the same on all levels of organization but for the parameters,
   which describe the dynamics such as
   [MATH: <lt;mi>gt;γ<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo>gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo>gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;
   :MATH]
   , to depend on the level or on the timescale
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   . For example, if the effective learning (or information-processing)
   rate
   [MATH: <lt;mi>gt;γ<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo>gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo>gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;
   :MATH]
   decreases with timescale
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   , then the local processing time, which depends on
   [MATH: <lt;mi>gt;γ<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo>gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo>gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;
   :MATH]
   , runs differently for different trainable variables: slower for
   slow-changing variables (or larger
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   ) and faster for fast-changing ones (or smaller
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   ). For such a system, the concept of global time (that is, the same
   time for all variables) becomes irrelevant and should be replaced with
   the proper or local time, which is defined for each scale
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   separately:
   [MATH: <lt;msub>gt;<lt;mi>gt;t<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mi
   mathvariant="italic">gt;τ<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;/msub>gt;<lt;mo>gt;∝<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi>gt;γ<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo>gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi

   [5.1]

   This effect closely resembles time dilation phenomena in physics,
   except that in special and general relativity, time dilation is linked
   with the possibility of movement between slow and fast clocks (or
   variables) (89). To illustrate the role time dilation plays in biology,
   consider only two types of variables: slow changing and fast changing.
   Then, the slow variables should be able to “outsource” certain
   computational tasks to faster variables. Because the local clock for
   the fast-changing variables runs faster, the slow-changing variables
   can take advantage of the fast-changing ones to accelerate computation,
   which would be rewarded by evolution. The flow of information between
   slow-changing and fast-changing variables in the opposite direction is
   also beneficial because the fast-changing variables can use the
   slow-changing variables to store useful information for future
   retrieval: that is, the slow variables function as long-term memory. In
   the next section, we show that such cooperation between slow- and
   fast-changing variables, which is a concrete manifestation of principle
   P7, corresponds to a crucial biological phenomenon as the Central Dogma
   of molecular biology (60).

6. Generalized Central Dogma of Molecular Biology

   In terms of learning theory, the two directions of the asymmetric
   information flow (P7) represent learning the state of the environment
   and predicting the state of the environment from the results of
   learning. For learning, information is passed from faster variables to
   slower variables, and for predicting, information flows in the opposite
   direction from slower variables to the faster ones. A more formal
   analysis of the asymmetric information flows (or a generalized Central
   Dogma) can be carried out by forward propagation (from slow variables
   to fast variables) and back propagation (from fast variables to slow
   variables) of information within the framework of the mathematical
   model of neural networks developed in the previous sections (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S3).

   would be countably infinite. Therefore, any finite-size organism has to
   “decide” which frequencies to observe (and remember) and which ones to
   filter out (and “forget”).

   Let us assume that the organism “decided” to only observe/remember
   discrete frequencies
   [MATH: <lt;msub>gt;<lt;mi>gt;f<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mi
   mathvariant="italic">gt;min<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;/msub>gt;<lt;mo>gt;≡<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;msub>gt;<lt;mi>gt;f<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;msub>gt;<lt;mi

   i mathvariant="italic">gt;max<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;/msub>gt;<lt;mo>gt;,<lt;/mo>gt; :MATH]
   [6.4]

   and forget everything else. Then, to predict the state of the
   environment [6.3] and as a result, minimize the loss function [4.5],
   the organism should be able to store, retrieve, and adjust information
   about coefficients
   [MATH: <lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;q<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mi>gt;k<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;/msup>gt; :MATH]
   in some adaptable trainable variables

   stretchy="true">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mi>gt;a<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="true">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   .

   Given this simple model, we can study the flow of information between
   different nontrainable variables of the organism
   [MATH: <lt;mrow>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo

   stretchy="true">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   . To this end, it is convenient to organize the variables as
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mo>gt;=<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo
   stretchy="true">gt;(<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;msup>gt;<lt;mi mathvariant="bold">gt;x<lt;/mi>gt;<lt;mrow>gt;<lt;mo

   which can be interpreted as passage of data from one layer to another
   in a deep, multilayer neural network (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Eq. 6.8
   implies that, during the predicting phase, relevant information only
   flows from variables encoding low frequencies to variables encoding
   high frequencies but not in the reverse direction. In other words, in
   the process of predicting the environment, information propagates from
   slower variables to faster variables: that is, from genotype to
   phenotype or from nucleic acids to proteins (hence, the Central Dogma).
   Because only the fast variables change in this process, the prediction
   of the state of the environment is rapid, as it is indeed required to
   be for the organism survival. Conversely, in the process of learning
   the environment, information is back propagated in the opposite
   direction: that is, from faster to slower variables. However, this back
   propagation is not a microscopic reversal of the forward propagation
   but a distinct, much slower process (given that changes in slow
   variables are required) that involves mutation and selection.

   Thus, the meaning of the generalized Central Dogma from the point of
   view of the learning theory—and our theory of evolution—is that slow
   dynamics (that is, evolution on a long timescale) should be mostly
   independent of the fast variables. In less formal terms, slow variables
   determine the rules of the game, and changing these rules depending on
   the results of some particular games would be detrimental for the
   organism. Optimization within the space of opportunities constrained by
   temporally stable rules is advantageous compared with optimization
   without such constraints. The trade-off between global and local
   optimization is a general, intrinsic property of frustrated systems
   (E2). For the system to function efficiently, the impact of local
   optimization on the global optimization should be restricted. The
   separation of the long-term and short-term forms of memory through
   different elemental bases (nucleic acids vs. proteins) serves this
   objective.

7. Discussion

   In this work, we outline a theory of evolution on the basis of the
   theory of learning. The parallel between learning and biological
   evolution becomes obvious as soon as the mapping between the loss
   function and the fitness function is established (Eq. 4.6). Indeed,
   both processes represent movement of an evolving (learning) system on a
   fitness (loss function) landscape, where adaptive (learning), upward
   moves are most consequential, although neutral moves are most common,
   and downward moves also occur occasionally. However, we go beyond the
   obvious analogy and trace a detailed correspondence between the
   essential features of the evolutionary and learning processes.
   Arguably, the most important fundamental commonality between evolution
   and learning is the stratification of the trainable variables (degrees
   of freedom) into classes that differ by the rate of change. At least in
   complex environments, all learning is multilevel, and so is all
   selection that is relevant for the evolutionary process. The framework
   of evolution as learning developed here implies that evolution of
   biological complexity would be impossible without MLS permeating the
   entire history of life. Under this perspective, emergence of new levels
   of organization, in learning and in evolution, and in particular, MTE
   represent genuine phase transitions as previously suggested (41). Such
   transitions can be analyzed consistently only in the thermodynamic
   limit, which is addressed in detail in the accompanying paper (86).

   The origin of complexity and long-term memory from simple fundamental
   physical laws is one of the hardest problems in all of science. One
   popular approach is synergetics pioneered by Haken (91, 92) and the
   related nonequilibrium thermodynamics founded by Prigogine and Stengers
   (93) that employ mathematical tools of the theory of dynamical systems,
   such as theory of bifurcations and analysis of attractors. However,
   these concepts appear to be too general and oversimplified to usefully
   analyze biological phenomena, which are far more complex than
   “dissipative structures” that are central to nonequilibrium
   thermodynamics, such as, for example, autowave chemical reactions.

   An alternative is the approach based on the theory of spin glasses (43,
   94), which employs the mathematical apparatus of statistical physics
   and seems to provide a deeper insight into the origin of complexity.
   However, the energy landscape of spin glasses contains too many minima
   that are too shallow to account for long-term memory that is central to
   biology (12, 41). Thus, some generalization of the spin glass concept
   is likely to be required for productive application in evolutionary
   biology (95).

   A popular and promising approach is self-organized criticality (SOC), a
   concept developed by Bak et al. (96, 97). Although relevant in
   biological contexts (12), SOC, by definition, implies self-similarity
   between different levels of organization, whereas biologically relevant
   complexity is rather associated with distinct emergent phenomena at
   different spatiotemporal scales (90).

   A fundamental shortcoming of all these approaches is that they do not
   include, at least not as a major component, evolutionary concepts, such
   as natural selection. The framework of learning theory used here allows
   us to naturally unify the descriptions of physical and biological
   phenomena in terms of optimization by trial and error and loss
   (fitness) functions. Indeed, a key point of the present analysis is
   that most of our general principles apply to both living and nonliving
   systems.

   The detailed correspondence between the key features of the processes
   of learning and biological evolution implies that this is not a simple
   analogy but rather, a reflection of the deep unity of evolutionary
   processes occurring in the universe. Indeed, separation of the relevant
   degrees of freedom into multiple temporal classes is ubiquitous in the
   universe from composite subatomic particles, such as protons, to atoms,
   molecules, life-forms, planetary systems, and galaxy clusters. If the
   entire universe is conceptualized as a neural network (36), all these
   systems can be considered emerging from the learning dynamics.
   Furthermore, scale separation and renormalizability appear to be
   essential conditions for a universe to be observable. According to the
   evolution theory outlined here, any observable universe consists of
   systems that undergo learning or synonymously, adaptive evolution, and
   actually, the universe itself is such a system (36). The famous dictum
   of Dobzhansky (98), thus, can and arguably should be rephrased as
   “[n]othing in the world is comprehensible except in the light of
   learning.”

   Within the theory of evolution outlined here, the difference between
   life and nonliving systems, however important, can be considered as one
   in the type and degree of optimization, so that all evolutionary
   phenomena can be described within the same formal framework of the
   theory of learning. Crucially, any complex optimization problem can be
   addressed only with a stochastic learning algorithm: hence, the
   ubiquity of selection. Origin of life can then be conceptualized within
   the framework of multilevel learning as we explicitly show in the
   accompanying paper (86). The point when life begins can be naturally
   associated with the emergence of a distinct class of slowly changing
   variables that are digitized and thus, can be accurately replicated;
   these digital variables store and supply information for forward
   propagation to predict the state of the environment. In biological
   terms, this focal point corresponds to the advent of replicators
   (genomes) that carry information on the operation of reproducers within
   which they reside (99). This is also the point when natural (Darwinian)
   selection takes off (64). Our theory of evolution implies that this
   pivotal stage was preceded by evolution of “prelife,” which comprised
   reproducers that lacked genomes but nevertheless, were learning systems
   that were subject to selection for persistence. Self-reproducing
   micelles that harbor autocatalytic protometabolic reaction networks
   appear to be plausible models of such primordial reproducers (100). The
   first replicators (RNA molecules) would evolve within these
   reproducers, perhaps, initially, as molecular parasites (E9) but
   subsequently, under selection for the ability to store, express, and
   share information essential for the entire system. This key step
   greatly increased the efficiency of evolution/learning and provided for
   long-term memory that persisted throughout the history of life,
   enabling the onset of natural selection and the unprecedented
   diversification of life-forms (E5). It has to be emphasized that,
   compared with the existing evolutionary models that explore replicator
   dynamics, the learning approach described here is more microscopic in
   that the existence of replicators is not initially assumed but rather,
   appears as an emergent property of multilevel learning dynamics. For
   learning to be efficient, the capacity of the system to add new
   adaptable variables is essential. In biological terms, this implies
   expandability of the genome (that is, the ability to add new genes),
   which necessitated the transition from RNA to DNA as the genome
   substrate given the apparent intrinsic size constraints on replicating
   RNA molecules. Another essential condition for efficient learning is
   information sharing, which in the biological context, corresponds to
   horizontal gene transfer. The essentiality of horizontal gene transfer
   at the earliest stages of life evolution is perceived as the cause of
   the universality of the translation machinery and genetic code in all
   known life-forms (101). The conceptual model of the origin of life
   implied by our learning-based theoretical framework appears to be fully
   compatible with Gánti’s chemoton, a model of protocell emergence and
   evolution based on autocatalytic reaction networks (102–104).

   The origin of life scenario within the encompassing framework of the
   present evolution theory, even if formulated in most general terms,
   implies that emergence of complexity commensurate with life is a
   general trend in the evolution of complex systems. At face value, this
   conclusion might seem to be at odds with the magnitude of
   complexification involved in the origin of life [suffice it to consider
   the complexity of the translation system (7)] and the uniqueness of
   this event, at least on Earth and probably, on a much greater cosmic
   scale. Nevertheless, the origin of life appears to be an expected
   outcome of learning subject to the relevant constraints, such as the
   presence of the required chemicals in sufficient concentrations. Such
   constraints would make life a rare phenomenon but likely far from
   unique on the scale of the universe. The universe is sometimes claimed
   to be fine-tuned for the existence of life (105). What we posit here is
   that the universe is self-tuned for life emergence.

   Evidently, the analysis presented here and in the accompanying paper
   (86) is only an outline of a theory of evolution as learning. The
   details and implications, including directly testable ones, remain to
   be worked out.

Abstract

   In recent years, an extension of the Darwinian framework is being
   considered for the study of prebiotic chemical evolution, shifting the
   attention from homogeneous populations of naked molecular species to
   populations of heterogeneous, compartmentalized and functionally
   integrated assemblies of molecules. Several implications of this shift
   of perspective are analysed in this critical review, both in terms of
   the individual units, which require an adequate characterization as
   self-maintaining systems with an internal organization, and also in
   relation to their collective and long-term evolutionary dynamics, based
   on competition, collaboration and selection processes among those
   complex individuals. On these lines, a concrete proposal for the set of
   molecular control mechanisms that must be coupled to bring about
   autonomous functional systems, at the interface between chemistry and
   biology, is provided.
   Keywords: chemical evolution, natural selection, origins of life,
   autonomous functional systems, prebiotic systems chemistry

1. Introduction

   About a century and a half ago, in his book On the Origin of Species,
   Charles R. Darwin proposed natural selection (NS) as the main driving
   force that guides the evolution of species, conceived as a process of
   descent with modification from a common ancestor. Today we have
   overwhelming evidence to support that this process has been
   continuously shaping the living world over time on the Earth and, thus,
   it constitutes a central paradigm of biology. Darwinian evolution must
   have started, at the latest, with the first population of living cells,
   whose precise characteristics remain inaccessible to us, but whose
   descendants originated, among other putative lineages later extinct,
   the so-called last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [1]. Without
   excluding other important factors (e.g. genetic drift, gene flow,
   population size/structure effects, symbiotic and mutualistic
   relationships, lateral gene transfer and sex), past and current
   biodiversity is therefore regarded as the outcome of evolutionary
   dynamics based on NS from LUCA [2].

   Nevertheless, a big scientific riddle not yet resolved is what happened
   before the first self-reproducing cellular organisms appeared on Earth,
   likely between 3.8 and 3.5 billion years ago. Although biological
   systems consist of well-described sets of coupled chemical reactions,
   very little is known about the transition from inanimate matter to
   living entities, i.e. from the most complicated chemistry we can think
   of to the simplest biology. The majority of researchers in the field of
   origins of life have worked under the assumption that a population of
   self-replicating RNA (or RNA-like) molecules started competing for a
   limited amount of resources (i.e. nucleotides or analogous monomers) in
   their local environment, and some form of NS already began operating at
   that chemical level [3–5]. This widespread conception is supported by
   two breakthroughs from last half-century molecular biology: (i) the
   development of in vitro molecular evolution technologies, which allowed
   to prove that populations of biopolymers with template properties
   could, indeed, change in time under artificial selective pressure
   [6–9]; and (ii) the discovery of ribozymes [10,11], which demonstrated
   the catalytic capacities of RNAs and, thereby, the dual role that this
   type of macromolecule might have played at the onset of life.

   As a result, some researchers have conjectured on a possible link
   between the emerging concept of chemical evolution and the established
   notion of biological evolution, considered as two different stages of a
   common natural process of matter complexification [12–15]. Uncovering
   possible mechanisms of chemical evolution that include early or
   minimalist versions of NS would then be crucial to understand how life
   originated on Earth—or, eventually, in a different extraterrestrial
   environment. Computational and theoretical studies carried out in the
   last years support that chemical kinetics may become evolutionary
   dynamics in populations of self-replicating molecules, or in
   collectively autocatalytic networks [16–18]. The overall idea behind
   these studies is that the evolutionary potential of such chemical
   systems would result from an increase in their dynamic stability as a
   consequence of the copying process or the cross-catalytic effects among
   the molecules in the network.

   Several key questions remain open in this context, however. First, why
   is it so hard to find artificial chemistries that spontaneously
   converge into systems or phenomena of higher complexity and dynamic
   stability? Is it because experimental scientists are not finding the
   right precursors and boundary conditions? Or is it because there are
   ‘evolutionary bottlenecks’—still to be identified and
   characterized—that must be overcome to trigger off such a behaviour?
   Secondly, is ‘kinetic control’ (i.e. the rate of template copying or
   the catalytic power of the molecules) the only relevant aspect to
   ensure the necessary dynamic robustness of those prebiotic systems that
   would, eventually, lead to the onset of open-ended, biological
   evolution? If not, what other types of control mechanisms or basic
   functions should be taken into account at those initial stages? More
   precisely, regarding the emergence of Darwinian evolutionary dynamics,
   how large must a primary ‘functional/phenotypic space’ be for NS to get
   established, or become operational? And, finally, granted that cyclic
   chemical reaction networks are so important for the living, how could
   they be initially kept together, away from thermodynamic equilibrium
   for long enough, so that they may actually reproduce and become
   evolvable individuals?

   Questions like the previous ones were rarely asked in the field of
   origins of life 20 years ago, when different research schools were
   still fighting for the prebiotic plausibility of their preferred
   biopolymer (e.g. nucleic acid versus protein) or biochemical process
   (template replication versus metabolic pathways). However, after the
   advent of systems approaches in biology at the turn of the century
   [19–21], chemistry is also taking up the challenge of dealing with
   increasingly intricate combinations of molecules at once, under various
   conditions and making use of novel experimental set-ups and
   technologies [22–27], which opens new perspectives and opportunities
   for research on the origins of life [28–31]. In that context, figure 1
   introduces our view about the main stages and bottlenecks involved in
   the transition from chemical to biological evolution, with emphasis on
   the evolutionary importance of establishing efficient functional
   couplings within chemical systems, as we will argue in more detail
   below. Of course, chemical evolutionary pathways (bottom part of the
   figure) will surely cover a wider research area than those potentially
   conducive to prebiotic phenomena. Nevertheless, some of them should
   turn into legitimate candidates to bring about lifelike dynamic
   behaviours, perhaps by means of alternative components and processes to
   the ones actually implemented in our biosphere. Despite the expected
   difficulties in establishing the ‘liveliness’ of these intermediate
   chemical systems, the necessity to start integrating organizational and
   evolutionary accounts of those kinds of complex (pre-bio)molecular
   phenomena is becoming less and less controversial, and that is
   precisely the area on which we focus this short critical review or
   perspective article.

   Scheme of the different stages and bottlenecks that could have occurred
   during the transition from chemical to biological evolution. Among the
   complex and interacting chemical mixtures present on early Earth, only
   those that developed the first functional couplings were available for
   the next step of the overall process. Further diversification of those
   coupled systems made stronger functional integration mechanisms
   possible, leading to—at least—one type of system in the population with
   sufficient dynamic/structural stability to overcome the bottleneck
   imposed by the need for reliable reproduction (including molecular
   template mechanisms). This stage corresponded to systems in which
   compartment, metabolism and replication (CMR) were tightly coupled. In
   turn, only those CMR systems that became capable of open-ended
   biological evolution (see explanation in the text) would show the
   long-term robustness required to follow the pathway to LUCA and its
   further diversification into the three domains of life.

2. Merging systems chemistry and evolutionary theory

   It is turning increasingly apparent that evolutionary theory can no
   longer keep the ‘black box’ of individuality closed. In particular, the
   triad ‘multiplication, variation and heredity’ cannot be simply assumed
   as a general set of conditions that define any unit of selection [2],
   but needs to be more precisely specified, if it is to carry any
   descriptive/predictive power. In turn, those approaches that invoke
   physico-chemical forces (e.g. self-organization and self-assembly,
   spatial constraints and energetic couplings) to support mechanistic or
   physiological accounts for the development of chemical complexity on
   the way to biological phenomena should be made coherent with the
   Darwinian framework, which explains the dynamics taking place at a
   population level. Oversimplifications, imposing either the evolutionary
   framework (i.e. disregarding the internal complexity of the
   individuals) or the physiological/organizational one (i.e. disregarding
   the power of evolutionary mechanisms), have not worked satisfactorily
   [32,33]. Thus, the challenge for origins-of-life research is to make
   use of systems chemistry to identify and characterize mixtures of
   biomolecular precursors that could get coupled into individuals with
   capacity for self-maintenance and potential increase in complexity
   (i.e. ‘proto-organisms’, taken as assemblies of different chemical
   species with functional attributes—see below). In parallel, researchers
   should carefully examine the evolutionary consequences of having one
   type of individual or another in the population, in terms of the
   competitive and selective dynamics that take place at that collective
   level, within a plausible geochemical setting.

   Two additional arguments can be given to support the necessity of
   merging the new systems approach and evolutionary theory. First, all
   known living beings are made of highly diverse and intertwined
   components and transformation processes. Simplifying their origins to
   the dynamics of one type of molecular component is a strong and
   reductionist conjecture, which should not be taken for granted. Second,
   in order to turn operational and lead to systems of increasing
   complexity, evolution by NS should have required, from the beginning,
   individuals who provide a wide enough space to express a phenotypic
   variety [34,35]. For example, although molecular evolution through
   artificial selection for a given phenotype (e.g. a given aptamer or an
   engineered ribozyme) has been clearly demonstrated to take place
   without any need for such ‘composite individuals’ [6–9,36], it is
   becoming more and more obvious that molecules of a single kind, no
   matter their structural complexity, face intrinsic bottlenecks due to
   the fact that they do not offer the wide phenotypic space required for
   the emergence of autonomous functional systems. The alternative
   scenario here proposed is not straightforward, either. In particular,
   it requires a high degree of chemical diversity and heterogeneity from
   the beginning, an apparent complication that some other researchers
   have also supported, with different strength and motivations [37–40].
   However, this is bound to pay back soon in terms of the behavioural
   richness and evolutionary potential displayed by the more complex
   individuals that are drawn in the process. Somehow (as we explain in
   more detail in the sections below), reaching that initial threshold of
   complexity would make it possible, for chemical systems that overcome a
   first set of evolutionary bottlenecks (bottom part of figure 1) and
   keep relatively robust dynamics, to display a wide range of chemical
   couplings and functional behaviours that would allow them, in turn, to
   undergo further prebiotic transitions (in particular, to originate
   ternary systems denoted as ‘CMR’ in figure 1).

   On these lines, acknowledging the importance of the input provided by
   the RNA World theory (as it was proposed 30 years ago [41], but also,
   more interestingly, through the recent advances in the prebiotic
   synthesis of its precursor molecules [42–45] or the improved
   elaborations on the general hypotheses behind it—both theoretical
   [46–48] and experimental [49,50]), one should nevertheless accept that
   an important gap remains in our understanding of the processes that
   could have spontaneously supported the emergence, maintenance and
   evolutionary potential of such a precellular world. Especially, it must
   be noted that various chemical reactions traditionally involved in the
   artificial organic syntheses of RNA precursors are thermodynamically
   uphill or show high kinetic barriers in the absence of activating
   molecules or catalysts, respectively. It looks highly more probable
   that before (or at the same time as) biopolymers with functional
   capacities came to the stage, other (simpler) molecular species and
   structures (e.g. small, non-coded peptides) had to be present, in close
   interaction with them. This is so because the latter would have
   provided, precisely, the enabling conditions for the robust, autonomous
   production of the former, as well as the phenotypic context within
   which those emergent biopolymers could carry out and unfold their
   diverse functional roles, including template replication.

   The problem is intricate, though: approaches that have suggested
   self-sustaining autocatalytic networks as an alternative basis for the
   origins of life (i.e. metabolism-first scenarios [51–56]) also face
   their own set of problems. Potentially capable of robust
   self-maintenance, autocatalytic networks have nevertheless obtained
   very little experimental support in prebiotic conditions [57,58], and
   hold severe theoretical limitations as well (e.g. the depletion of
   certain network intermediates when side reactions are considered, or
   the lack of evolvability in the absence of some mechanism of heredity
   [16]).

   In addition, both ‘replication-first’ and ‘metabolism-first’ approaches
   face further trouble, such as the permanent threat of dilution and the
   spatio-temporal coordination of the underlying processes. These
   difficulties seem to force the inclusion of self-assembled compartments
   in the picture, as they incorporate selectively permeable boundaries
   that could keep concentration levels of the relevant chemical species
   above critical thresholds, and would mark a clear ‘inside–outside’
   distinction (i.e. a strong criterion of individuality). At the same
   time, the presence of such compartments (commonly assumed to be
   vesicles with an internal aqueous core, but perhaps initially reducible
   to simpler, two-phase systems—like droplets or Oparin's ‘coacervates’)
   would provide the adequate scale and scaffold for molecules to start
   getting organized functionally and would turn those complex molecular
   systems into lifelike individuals with capacity to evolve as
   protocellular systems (e.g. [59,60]).

   Thus, one can reformulate the question of the origins of life in the
   following global terms: before full-fledged biological systems appeared
   on Earth, what systems could overcome the apparent thermodynamic
   barrier to complexification and produce the rather intricate
   self-reproducing entities that initiated evolution in a Darwinian
   sense? There is no current answer for this riddle; therefore, we need a
   more general conceptual framework to understand chemical evolution. The
   required theory should account for the increase in complexity that
   occurred in prebiotic times, when chemistry was already complex and
   heterogeneous but still far from generating the self-replicating
   polymers, the self-sustaining protometabolic cycles and the
   self-multiplying protocellular compartments whose efficient functional
   integration brought about the first living systems. In the remaining
   sections of this prospective review, a first sketch of what such a new
   conceptual framework might look like is offered, relating it to several
   key advances that have occurred in the field of ‘prebiotic systems
   chemistry’ [28] during the last few years.

3. Chemical evolution through the development of autonomous functional
systems

   Our perspective considers an extension of the Darwinian framework for
   the study of prebiotic chemical evolution, but not in the traditional
   way that this has been carried out within the field of origins (i.e.
   searching for minimal self-replicating molecular systems [61–65]) or,
   more recently, with the inclusion of compartments under a similar
   scheme [60,66–68]. Instead, we suggest to apply an evolutionary account
   in the context of autonomous systems that are made of diverse
   combinations of chemical precursors (i.e. (bio)molecules and their
   supramolecular assemblies). The underlying hypothesis is that, under
   adequate physico-chemical conditions, those molecular species and
   assemblies will achieve a collective reinforcement through various
   types of interaction (e.g. mutual chemical transformations, recognition
   and control relationships, self-assembly, pattern formation, collective
   synchronization phenomena and physical boundary effects). Consequently,
   some of these mixed bio-precursors, together with the processes that
   they trigger off in interaction, will increase their dynamic/structural
   stability by becoming functionally engaged with each other. This should
   enable researchers to design experiments of competition and selection
   among different types of such individuals, in order to test their
   actual dynamic robustness and evolutionary potential.

   Central to our account is the idea of function, a key concept in
   biology that is projectable to a chemical scenario. By function we
   understand any distinct contribution, by a distinguishable part of a
   system, to the maintenance of that system as a whole [69,70]. In other
   words, we take a dispositional (organizational) standpoint with regard
   to this concept, which highlights its relational character. A part of
   the system (e.g. a molecule), by itself, does not have a function. It
   can only have it in connection to other components of such a system,
   that is, in the context of an organization. In general, an organization
   can belong to the natural world or be human-made (e.g. an artificial
   device or machine). The main difference between them consists in
   whether the function is defined externally (i.e. by the person building
   the machine, with all its parts) or has an endogenous source and goal.
   We are interested in spontaneously formed, autonomous systems, like
   living organisms, so the focus here will be on the latter.

   A preliminary reflection, from the definition just given, is that it
   will be hard—if not impossible—to find natural systems with only one or
   two functions. Accordingly, one of the key issues to address is
   determining the minimal number and type of chemical
   components/interactions required to obtain a system in which
   relationships can start being properly considered as functional. In
   other words, a central motivation behind our proposal consists in
   naturalizing an organizational conception of function, endowed with
   biological (i.e. physiological) meaning, but well-grounded in
   evolutionary systems chemistry.

   This perspective may hold some similarities with other theoretical
   schemes recently developed with the aim to explain the evolution of
   complex systems. Pascal et al. [14], for example, argue about a
   sequence of stages in which chemical systems of increasing stability or
   robustness appear, thus opening the possibility for new developments
   within the time window allowed by their relative stability. In addition
   to some thermodynamic considerations of interest (e.g. ‘the cost of
   irreversibility’), these authors focus on the idea that stability could
   be provided by reaction kinetics, whenever there are autocatalytic or
   replication processes involved (i.e. what they refer to as ‘dynamic
   kinetic control’ [13–15]). This is indeed a relevant contribution to
   the field, coherent with the state-of-the-art experimental research,
   yet we feel that the problem, right from the beginning, presents more
   variables than just molecular kinetics (see below).

   Another recent contribution that could hold some resemblance with ours
   is the ‘synergism hypothesis’ [71], since it defends that cooperative
   phenomena of various kinds may synchronize and produce novel, combined
   functional advantages, as a result of which ‘synergistic wholes’ would
   become the actual units of evolutionary change. However, even if this
   account of ‘function’ highlights it as a relational concept, as we do,
   the theoretical framework where it is embedded is very different,
   centred on the evolution of biological complexity. Corning and
   Szathmary develop their ideas from an evolutionary theory background,
   discarding the paradigms of ‘self-organization’ and classical
   ‘complexity sciences’ as significant contributions to the problem. In
   contrast, we propose a full integration between the two traditions.
   With that aim, a first approximation to a theory of autonomous
   functional systems is put forward in the next section, including
   ingredients from evolutionary biology and also from physics and
   chemistry, so that a better understanding about basic/minimal
   biological organization can be reached (i.e. about the actual units of
   life, not just about abstract ‘units of evolution’).

4. Outline of a theory of autonomous functional systems

   It is out of the scope of this short critical review to give a full
   account of the emergence of autonomous (bio)chemical functions. In
   fact, the empirical results and theoretical insights delivered so far
   by the field of systems chemistry are not yet fully ripe to tackle such
   a task. Nevertheless, we would like to put on the table a concrete
   hypothesis, with the aim to illustrate the global idea that the problem
   involves several irreducible dimensions and, therefore, must be given a
   multidimensional solution. This is depicted in figure 2, which shows
   four different though interdependent types of control mechanisms that,
   according to our view, are fundamental requirements to assemble
   autonomous functional systems with evolutionary potential to become
   biological.

   Figure 2.

   Schematic of the minimal set of control mechanisms that should operate,
   in a highly interdependent manner, to support the development of the
   first autonomous functional systems in the context of heterogeneous
   prebiotic chemistries. These mechanisms involve: (i) kinetic control,
   to coordinate the different reaction processes in time and enable
   transformations that reinforce the incipient chemistry but would
   otherwise be kinetically hindered; (ii) spatial control, to establish a
   clear inside/outside distinction and preserve minimal concentration
   thresholds of the relevant chemical species; (iii) energetic control,
   to facilitate the thermodynamically uphill but necessary reactions; and
   (iv) variability control, for these systems to have a minimal chance to
   evolve, through NS, into more complex forms. These four types of
   control mechanisms are represented as the vertices of a tetrahedron
   (with candidate molecular and supramolecular components suggested in
   red) and connected to each other by integrative and cooperative
   chemical couplings (black edges). Individuals with such an irreducible
   heterogeneity in their composition (and complexity in their dynamic
   behaviour) would constitute proper candidates as units of selection in
   this extended framework to conceive prebiotic chemical evolution. As a
   result of that evolutionary process, one could envision further
   functional diversification and more efficient integration (through new
   coupling processes), which would confer higher dynamic robustness to
   increasingly complex individuals in the population (a stage that is
   schematically illustrated by the multiple tetrahedron within the
   initial, elementary one).

   The implementation of those mechanisms could be achieved by different
   molecular components, but our thesis is that all of them: (i) must be
   produced from a common web of interlinked reaction and transformation
   processes; and (ii) must play a role in the maintenance of such a web,
   that is, they become intrinsically functional, as distinguishable parts
   of a system with differentiated contributions to its maintenance.
   Technically speaking, they are constraints on the dynamic behaviour of
   other material components of the system, and they exert mutual
   reinforcing influences on each other (i.e. they constitute functionally
   coupled constraints). The autonomy of the system therefore comes from
   its capacity to synthesize those components that, precisely, turn
   functional [72,73]. In other words, not all components of the system
   need to be internally synthesized (i.e. many will actually be taken up
   from the environment) but those that become functional should derive
   from—or be directly involved in— the incipient, protometabolic reaction
   network.

   This is why it is so important, in the design and implementation of
   experiments, to work with molecular precursors rather than with final
   functional products—such as biopolymers or their aggregates. And this
   is why the problem of origins of life is, ultimately, a chemical
   problem. Nevertheless, we have no chance to find the relevant chemistry
   towards life unless we think about it from biology: from our knowledge
   of current living beings and, in particular, of the core functions
   performed by universal biochemical mechanisms. This takes us back to
   figure 2, and to the explanation of why we have chosen a tetrahedron as
   the geometry that best captures our proposal, which assumes that those
   functions (control mechanisms) can be implemented chemically, as is
   briefly described in the next paragraphs.

4.1. Kinetic control

   This is the most evident control mechanism to be introduced, already
   considered pivotal by a majority of researchers. In fact, most
   origins-of-life experts conceive the problem as a transition from
   thermodynamic to kinetic control, eventually championed by genetically
   encoded enzymes [74,75]. So, the main difficulty around this vertex of
   the tetrahedron is not highlighting its importance, but finding what
   type of components could have carried out catalytic tasks before the
   advent of stereospecific protein enzymes. The field of organocatalysis
   should provide many potential candidates, but the methods applied in
   this area of research are typically looking for the optimization of
   single synthetic processes, mostly for the chemical industry, and they
   lack a prebiotic, systems view in their approach. Oligopeptides
   constitute the most parsimonious option, without excluding
   oligonucleotides that could have also played catalytic roles, like
   ribozymes do in current biochemistry. However, a lot has to be explored
   in this direction, including the contribution of mineral surfaces or
   multi-layers, metal ions or other types of low-molecular-weight
   compounds that could work as co-factors. Also, the presence of soft
   supramolecular structures (e.g. fatty acid- or lipid-made vesicles) may
   have an effect on the yield and the kinetics of processes that are not
   so favourable in bulk aqueous solution [76,77]. This brings us to the
   right-hand vertex of the tetrahedron depicted in figure 2.

4.2. Spatial control

   Together with the temporal coordination of reaction processes, it is
   fundamental to develop mechanisms that harness the movement and spatial
   distribution of the various molecules that constitute the system. This
   is required not only to avoid dilution effects in free solution, which
   are always a threat to its cohesiveness, but also to enrich chemical
   behaviour itself—like Turing demonstrated long ago [78] and other
   authors have also highlighted as a key for the problem of life origins
   [79,80]. Indeed, the concentrations and spatial organization of the
   molecular components of all living beings (and, thereby, their
   metabolic activity, robustness and viability under changes in the
   external conditions) depend critically on their cellular nature.
   Furthermore, the actual identity and individuality of living systems is
   defined through the synthesis of their own boundaries and the
   mechanisms of interaction with their environment, which are usually
   anchored to the cell membrane [72]. Extensive experimental work during
   the last decades suggests that, at a very primitive stage of prebiotic
   chemical evolution, these boundaries were probably lipidic in nature,
   yet involving much simpler molecular structures and compositions than
   current ones [81–83].

4.3. Energetic control

   In addition to kinetic and spatial control mechanisms, energy
   transduction is also at the heart of the problem, precisely because
   some of the necessary synthetic processes tend to be endergonic, and
   thus need to be coupled to exergonic ones. In a prebiotic context,
   these thermodynamic hurdles could be overcome through the activation of
   substrates with coupling reagents (e.g. cyanamide, carbodiimides and
   carbonyldiimidazole) [84–87] or making use of electrochemical gradients
   established across lipidic membranes [88]. In addition, pyrophosphate
   may have played the role of a primitive energy currency, while
   aminoacyl adenylates would represent an activated form of amino acids
   with a potential evolutionary connection with central molecules of the
   current translational machinery [89,90].

   Thus, kinetic, spatial and energetic control mechanisms must interweave
   to bring about chemistries that support the minimum levels of
   complexity required for a system to become functionally autonomous
   [72]. In this context, cooperative events that make a new catalyst
   and/or a new energetic currency accessible, facilitating the synthesis
   of other components of the network, can be promoted (even if they imply
   a transition to higher levels of chemical complexity) if they confer a
   selectable advantage to the system as a whole, increasing its overall
   robustness. At some point, though, a ‘trade-off’ between complexity and
   stability will show up: the higher the complexity of the functional
   components and their relationships, the more difficult it becomes
   retaining them, without changes, in the system. After all,
   self-maintenance is based on far-from-equilibrium reaction cycles in
   which there is a continuous turnover of the molecular species involved.
   This reveals an unavoidable evolutionary bottleneck in any realistic
   prebiotic scenario, and this is why the fourth vertex of the
   tetrahedron, related to the capacity of controlling variability, must
   be included.

4.4. Variability control

   It seems reasonable to assume that, at first, there would be little
   control on variation in these compartmentalized chemical mixtures. But,
   as we said above, the efficacy of NS depends on the appearance of
   mechanisms through which an accurate transmission of key features of
   these systems to their ‘progeny’ should be guaranteed—or, at least,
   turn statistically significant. Further research, including
   experimental work, must be carried out in order to determine how
   prominent variability control turns out to be during the initial stages
   of the evolutionary process, when system reproduction is probably a
   rather stochastic event [66,91,92]. Yet, there is no doubt that it must
   come into play, along with the implementation of mechanisms of heredity
   showing increasing reliability, for these prebiotic systems to overcome
   the abovementioned complexity–stability bottleneck.

   In relation to this point, the capacity for cyclic and stationary
   reproduction regimes could well come about only as a result of
   subsequent stages in which a stronger degree of functional integration
   is achieved (see the mid-upper part of figure 1, roughly corresponding
   to the inner polyhedron in figure 2). Nevertheless, those stages could
   not develop out of the blue: the previous co-localization and
   coordination of supramolecular assemblies (e.g. vesicles and
   coacervates), catalysts (e.g. small-molecule organocatalysts, peptides
   or short oligonucleotides) and some energy currencies (e.g.
   electrochemical gradients and coupling agents, like pyrophosphate or
   some other ATP precursor) would be required [29]. The emergence of
   complex chemistries that resemble biochemistries (represented in the
   upper layers of figure 1) therefore implies, according to our view, the
   previous synthesis of a relatively wide variety of relatively simple
   molecular species and supramolecular assemblies (in the lower layers of
   figure 1), which have immediate effects on those actual synthetic
   processes, reinforcing their couplings and overall dynamic stability.

5. Implications for the origins of life

   The most important—and most difficult—aspect of the problem, as it has
   been approached here, is to determine specific sets of processes and
   chemical couplings that could support the coordination of the primary
   functions required to put together and maintain prebiotic autonomous
   systems. According to what we just emphasized at the end of the
   previous section, the minimal functional systems that we are focusing
   on should be generally considered as protocells, as they involve
   heterogeneous assemblies of molecules in compartments whose dynamic
   behaviour is intrinsically linked with chemical reactions and various
   other processes [93].

   Chemistry, fortunately, offers multiple options for the emergence and
   development of those composite protocellular individuals: (i) direct
   reaction couplings (i.e. transformation processes that share one or
   more chemical species); (ii) negative and positive feedback loops
   (autocatalytic cycles); (iii) stoichiometric couplings between several
   autocatalytic cycles, a la Ganti [94,95]; (iv) physical restrictions on
   molecular movement (by means of diverse kinds of boundaries); (v)
   osmotic couplings, if the chemical system is encapsulated within a
   volume-changing compartment (like a lipid vesicle) [96]; (vi)
   self-assembly processes (sustaining supramolecular structures); (vii)
   oligomerization reactions; (viii) endergonic–exergonic couplings (like
   (i), but with an energy currency involved); (ix) catalyst-mediated
   couplings (like in reflexive autocatalytic sets, a la Kauffman)
   [53,55]; and (x) regulatory couplings (second-order control mechanisms,
   in response to internal/external perturbations) [97].

   These options are not mutually exclusive: they could operate in
   parallel, or intermingled. Several components from the vertices of the
   tetrahedron in figure 2, or combinations thereby (e.g. a peptide
   inserted into a lipid membrane), could actually be involved in
   different kinds of those couplings. The main point here is that a
   relatively simple (pre-biopolymer) chemical scenario already comprises
   plenty of diversity, both in terms of material components and processes
   of transformation. In fact, the degree of diversity is such that it is
   bound to trigger a combinatorial explosion of variables and parameters,
   difficult to handle. The new methodologies that systems chemists are
   developing to analyse complex molecular mixtures and heterogeneous
   assemblies will be helpful in this regard [28,98,99]. However, the
   problem of combinatorial explosion will not be tamed unless we
   integrate knowledge from synthetic biology and the top-down approaches
   toward achieving minimal cells in the laboratory [100,101], in order to
   restrict chemical options and to design experiments involving the
   proper suite of molecular precursors under prebiotically relevant
   conditions.

   Furthermore, the required experimental work should be done not only
   under constant environmental conditions, but also in competitive
   scenarios, i.e. in interaction with other protocellular systems with
   similar energetic and material requirements [66,68,92]. If resources
   (i.e. substrates or energy supplies) are kept limited, this competition
   will eventually lead to selective dynamics in which certain
   combinations of functions (e.g. those who prove to be more efficient,
   more robust, etc.) will remain in the population. Therefore, a
   correlation between functional properties, coupling and integrative
   mechanisms, NS and evolutionary dynamics should be drawn.

   In this respect, our intuition is that during a first period of
   prebiotic chemical evolution, fitness would be simply associated with
   the dynamic stability of protocellular systems, taken as individual
   units. Then, as a result of the collective dynamics and interactions
   that are bound to occur in this context (not only competitive, but also
   including collaborative or ‘symbiotic’ interactions), individuals with
   a more complex and functionally integrated organization would possibly
   come about (again, represented by the inner polyhedron in figure 2).
   The new properties of these selected individuals (e.g. more reliable
   reproduction, higher control of variability and more efficient
   catalysis), would, in turn, allow for new evolutionary dynamics, with a
   stronger operational power of NS. This would get progressively closer
   to an open-ended evolution type of process, like the one we observe in
   the current biosphere (corresponding to the upper layer of figure 1).
   The key evolutionary transitions that could have occurred in the
   proposed scenario, together with the corresponding molecular entities
   involved, are depicted in figure 3. The later stages of prebiotic
   evolution (sketched on the right-hand side of figure 3) are also
   relevant, but lie outside the scope of the present contribution.

   chemistry and the overall process of origins of life. The notion of
   protocell populations employed here is remarkably wide, understood as
   heterogeneous, compartmented and functionally integrated assemblies of
   molecules that could implement, in successive stages, the different
   processes, capacities and mechanisms shown at the lower part of the
   figure.

6. Conclusion

   In this prospective critical review, we have focused on the first steps
   of the process of the origins of life, which have important
   implications for subsequent stages. Ours constitute a non-conventional
   approach to prebiotic evolution, because it shifts the attention from
   homogeneous populations of molecules to populations of heterogeneous,
   compartmentalized and functionally integrated assemblies of molecules.
   The consequences of such a shift of perspective are multiple, both at
   the level of the individual units—which require an adequate
   characterization as self-maintaining systems with an internal
   organization—and also in terms of their collective and long-term
   evolutionary dynamics, based on competition, collaboration and
   selection mechanisms that are in need of further investigation.

   The fact that such compartmentalized individuals possess an internal
   organization allows speaking about function in a physiologically
   relevant sense, because one can distinguish between parts of the system
   that contribute in a distinctive way to its maintenance as a whole.
   Immediate research goals to be targeted, in this context, will be: (i)
   the implementation of feasible versions of these composite systems,
   under specific experimental conditions; and (ii) the careful analysis
   and characterization of the roles played by the various kinds of
   molecules involved in the integrative process, ascribing functional
   properties to each of them. In this way, the concept of function has
   good chances to get naturalized, opening a scientific research
   programme to discover its deep chemical roots. As a result, new
   perspectives and theoretical approaches to understand evolvability as a
   general property of matter, well-grounded in experimental data, should
   also be brought forth.

Abstract

   What is the best way to teach evolution? As microevolution may be
   configured as a branch of genetics, it being a short conceptual leap
   from understanding the concepts of mutation and alleles (i.e.,
   genetics) to allele frequency change (i.e., evolution), we hypothesised
   that learning genetics prior to evolution might improve student
   understanding of evolution. In the UK, genetics and evolution are
   typically taught to 14- to 16-y-old secondary school students as
   separate topics with few links, in no particular order and sometimes
   with a large time span between. Here, then, we report the results of a
   large trial into teaching order of evolution and genetics. We modified
   extant questionnaires to ascertain students’ understanding of evolution
   and genetics along with acceptance of evolution. Students were assessed
   prior to teaching, immediately post teaching and again after several
   months. Teachers were not instructed what to teach, just to teach in a
   given order. Regardless of order, teaching increased understanding and
   acceptance, with robust signs of longer-term retention. Importantly,
   teaching genetics before teaching evolution has a significant (p <lt;
   0.001) impact on improving evolution understanding by 7% in
   questionnaire scores beyond the increase seen for those taught in the
   inverse order. For lower ability students, an improvement in evolution
   understanding was seen only if genetics was taught first. Teaching
   genetics first additionally had positive effects on genetics
   understanding, by increasing knowledge. These results suggest a simple,
   minimally disruptive, zero-cost intervention to improve evolution
   understanding: teach genetics first. This same alteration does not,
   however, result in a significantly increased acceptance of evolution,
   which reflects a weak correlation between knowledge and acceptance of
   evolution. Qualitative focus group data highlights the role of
   authority figures in determination of acceptance.

Author summary

   What is the best way to teach evolution? We hypothesised that if
   students know the fundamental concepts of genetics, then this might
   help them understand evolution better. To evaluate this, we performed a
   large trial in which pupils in United Kingdom secondary schools were
   either taught genetics and then evolution or evolution and then
   genetics. We found that the students being taught genetics first had a
   5%–10% improvement in their understanding of evolution, above that
   shown in the group taught evolution first. The change was seen in both
   higher- and foundation-ability classes. Indeed, in the foundation
   classes the genetics-first approach was the only approach that enabled
   an increase in evolution understanding. Teaching genetics first comes
   at no cost to genetics understanding (and may even improve it).
   However, the genetics-first approach was no different from the
   evolution-first approach in helping the acceptance of evolution.
   Qualitative follow-up studies indicated a major role for authority
   figures in determining acceptance, potentially explaining the weak
   correlation between understanding and acceptance. These results suggest
   a simple, minimally disruptive, zero-cost intervention to improve
   evolution understanding: teach genetics first.

Introduction

   While Dobzhansky famously wrote, “nothing in biology makes sense except
   in the light of evolution” [1], evolution remains one of the most
   misunderstood topics in biology [2–4]. Despite its importance, public
   understanding and acceptance of evolution is considered poor [5,6].
   School-level teaching of evolution is, thus, important, at the very
   least because this is often potentially the first formal introduction
   many people have to the scientific understanding of the theory. There
   are, however, concerns over its unsatisfactory teaching [5,7,8]. Many
   studies suggest that not all teachers fully understand the theory of
   evolution [9–15] and that some teachers incorporate alternative
   nonscientific explanations within evolution lessons or even avoid the
   topic completely [8,10,16,17]. Students’ grasp of evolution is often
   poor and does not always agree with the scientific understanding
   [18–21]. Commensurately, numerous studies report low levels of
   understanding among first year undergraduate students [22–24]. These
   factors likely contribute to the poor public understanding of evolution
   reported by many researchers, including in the UK context [25,26]. This
   tempts the question, what are the best methods to teach evolution?

   This issue here is currently much debated, particularly at the
   secondary school level (e.g. [27–29]). This is because the theory of
   evolution can be a controversial issue [8,16,30]. Strong opposition is
   well documented in the United States (e.g., [31–39]), but there is
   increasing concern about the impact that religious movements or strong
   cultural and social traditions may have on evolution education in other
   countries, including Northern Ireland [40], Poland [41], Turkey [42],
   and the UK [25,43]. There are also concerns that creationism has been
   taught in UK schools and that religious-motivated groups have attempted
   to influence science lessons [25,43,44]. More generally, numerous
   studies have focused on impediments to understanding and acceptance of
   evolution. While religious orientation [42,45–47], prior
   acceptance/rejection of the theory of evolution [46,48,49], and views
   of authority figures including teachers and religious leaders
   [16,18,48] are commonly cited reasons, reasoning skills
   [18,19,45,48,50,51] are also considered to be of importance. However,
   there has been relatively little work focused on improving teaching and
   understanding of evolution. Much of the current evolution education
   research is based on university students or teachers and may not be
   applicable to school students. Secondary school level biology is
   usually compulsory for all students up to the age of 16, whereas
   university level courses are likely to be taken by more scientifically
   and academically oriented students, therefore studies related to
   university students need not be very meaningful for younger learners.

   Regardless of whether there is any real reason for concern, there is no
   research within the UK that we are aware of that investigates evolution
   acceptance and understanding amongst secondary school-aged students or
   that investigates factors that might impact understanding and
   acceptance. If concerns over evolution education are genuine, then
   research is needed to find the best way to improve the situation. If,
   however, there is less need for concern, UK students may provide an
   interesting research focus as to how best to teach evolution, which
   could be applicable not just within the UK but in countries where
   evolution acceptance is more problematic.

   As microevolution may be configured as a branch of genetics, it being a
   short conceptual leap from understanding the concepts of mutation and
   alleles (i.e., genetics) to allele frequency change (i.e., evolution),
   we hypothesised that learning genetics prior to evolution might improve
   student understanding of evolution. Prior research suggests a
   relationship between evolution acceptance and genetics understanding,
   or “genetic literacy,” exists [6]. This idea of a relationship between
   knowledge of genetics and acceptance of evolution has not been widely
   studied. It seems intuitive to hypothesise that good understanding of
   genetics should help understanding, and possibly acceptance, of
   evolution. DNA is the heritable material through which variation needed
   for evolution occurs. Moreover, as basic genetics (as opposed to
   applied genetics, genetically modified [GM] crops, cloning, etc.) is a
   relatively neutral subject and not considered controversial in the ways
   that evolution might be, teaching genetics first could be a means of
   improving evolution education without any concerns over potentially
   controversial issues.

   There are supporters of linking the teaching of evolution with
   genetics, but for the most part, this is based on opinion [28,52].
   There are also some that do not view a role for genetics as helpful,
   noting that Darwin didn’t know about genetics [53]. However, this
   argument would seem counterproductive, as the study of genetics does
   provide further understanding of, and evidence for, the theory of
   evolution. Moreover, Darwin’s argument for the logic of Natural
   Selection in the early chapters of the Origin of Species specifically
   required a heritable component [54]. There are rare examples of studies
   in which trial teaching programmes include a sequential aspect [19],
   but overall improvements in students’ understanding of evolution and
   genetics may have been linked to the constructivist nature of the
   teaching programme, rather than the order of topics or any links made
   between them. Clearly, there is scope for further work related to this.

   The test that we perform is based within the UK setting. Since the
   National Curriculum was introduced for schools in England and Wales in
   1988, evolution has been a compulsory part of secondary science classes
   and is currently included in GCSE (General Certificate of Education)
   science and biology examination courses, typically taught to
   14–16-year-olds [25,55]. This is when most students are first
   introduced to the theory of evolution during their school education.
   Parenthetically, this situation is changing, as evolution was
   introduced to the primary curriculum in 2014. This does not affect the
   students involved in this research study, but it will be very
   interesting to see if and how this earlier introduction impacts
   students as they progress onto secondary school and beyond.

   The secondary school biology GCSE courses involved in this research
   project contain separate modules or topics featuring evolution and
   genetics. Most of these do not specifically link evolution and
   genetics, despite the obvious relationship between the two. According
   to exam board specifications and many secondary school textbooks,
   evolution is supported by fossil evidence, but there is rarely any
   mention of genetics. Students are generally taught within “higher”- or
   “foundation”- ability classes, and the hours of tuition and exact
   content studied varies between these sets. Although both genetics and
   evolution are taught to secondary school-aged students, the order of
   these topics depends on exam boards and school or teacher preference,
   and topics are not necessarily taught consecutively.

   We hypothesise that if students learn about genetics before evolution,
   this simple intervention could have a positive impact on learning. Our
   motivation for this test is not simply one based on some limited prior
   data and intuition. Rather, at least within the UK context, teachers
   are under unprecedented pressures, be these of time, resources, or
   regular changes to the curriculum. For a suggested change to teaching
   practices to have scope to be readily adopted, we sought to find
   interventions that are cost free, minimally disruptive, and require no
   further changes to what is taught. Thus, in our trial all that was
   changed was the order of teaching of material; exactly what was to be
   taught was left to teachers’ discretion. Moreover, what they were
   teaching is constrained by the stipulations of the different exam
   boards. Our experimental design thus attempts to mimic what would
   happen were any new ordering to be made policy.

   In brief, we asked teachers to teach in 1 of 2 orders: genetics first
   or evolution first. As it would be unethical to request some students
   not to be taught both subjects, we have no control. Our design may be
   considered a version of a crossover design [56]. The students were
   tested before being taught, immediately after and then several months
   after. Student response we define in 3 dimensions: understanding of
   evolution, understanding of genetics, and acceptance of evolution.
   Understanding of evolution (and genetics) refers to knowledge of a
   subject and practical application of this knowledge (here, evolution
   and genetics) and is different from acceptance, which refers to
   agreement with an idea or theory or the recognition that a position is
   valid or correct (here, the theory of evolution). The quantitative
   tests were modifications of accepted tests of genetics understanding,
   evolution understanding, and evolution acceptance. We followed up with
   more limited quantitative analysis from interviews with students. With
   a large number of classes being analysed, we presumed that our attempts
   to randomise which teacher teaches in which order would remove teacher,
   class, or cohort effects. Sample sizes for the longer-term retention
   are limited, and we could only assess general trends, not order
   effects. We noted when schools divided students between high- and
   foundation-ability classes and stratified with respect to this
   variable.

   We ask first whether teaching has any demonstrable impact on
   understanding and whether “ability” has any effect. “Ability” is very
   crudely used as an estimate of intelligence, which in itself is highly
   debated and complex to define. Here, ability is based on whether
   students are set within a higher-ability class and likely to be entered
   for a higher-tier exam, or whether they are within a lower-ability set
   and entered for a foundation-tier exam. We then ask whether teaching
   order affects the extent of change in understanding of evolution and of
   genetics. Importantly, we find evidence that teaching genetics first
   improves the understanding of evolution, but also of genetics, more
   than teaching evolution first improves both understandings. Indeed, in
   the foundation class evolution understanding goes up only if genetics
   is taught first. Finally, we address the issue of whether the same
   intervention affects acceptance of evolution. We find no evidence that
   teaching order modulates increases in evolution acceptance. This
   possibly stems from the weak correlation between understanding of
   evolution and acceptance. We employed a qualitative methodology to
   explore possible reasons for this.

Results

Understanding of genetics and evolution

Teaching has a positive impact on knowledge of evolution and genetics

   If one of the purposes of education is to impart knowledge, then one
   would hope that teaching has a positive impact on students’
   understanding of the topics being taught. We examined whether this is
   the case for evolution and genetics. Teaching has a positive impact on
   knowledge of genetics, (Fig 1A, Z = 177,834 p <lt; .001) and on knowledge
   of evolution (Fig 1B, Z = 130,876.5, p <lt; .001). Students’ knowledge of
   genetics increased by 2 marks (6%) on average, and by half a mark (8%)
   for evolution knowledge, but there was a wide range of variation.
   Teaching only had a positive impact on the evolution knowledge of 48%
   of students. 26% showed no change, and 26% showed a decrease in
   understanding.

   acceptance—pre: n = 388, post: n = 365, retention: n = 329).

   Raw data can be found in S1 and S2 Data.

Higher-ability students gain more knowledge of evolution

   Teaching has a positive impact on evolution understanding for
   higher-ability students (Z = 95,800.5, p <lt; .001) and for foundation
   students, (Z = 2,746, p <lt; .001). However, higher-ability students have
   a greater level of evolution understanding before teaching (W =
   223,415.5, p <lt; .001) and after teaching (W = 169,066, p <lt; .001). A
   linked matching pairs approach has been taken to further investigate
   the differences between ability groups. In this, we consider
   individuals of equal score in the preteaching scores, pairing those
   from different strata. We then consider the difference in increment in
   score for each pair. We then compare the values of these differential
   increments between the strata. By doing so, any influences that
   determined preteaching score are effectively eliminated as a covariate.

   Both groups show a significant increase in understanding evolution
   (higher: Z = 2,888.5, p <lt; .001, lower: Z = 2,746, p <lt; .001), but there
   is a significant difference between the groups after teaching, with
   higher-ability students showing a greater understanding of evolution
   compared to those from foundation sets (W = 43761, p <lt; .001), even when
   students start with the same understanding of evolution. ANCOVA
   predicting score change as a function of ability with pretest score as
   a covariate similarly finds an affect of ability, with higher-ability
   students having higher change scores (estimate 0.32, p = 0.002). This
   result might suggest that current teaching practices work best for
   higher-ability students.

Higher-ability students gain more knowledge of genetics

   Teaching also has a positive impact on understanding of genetics both
   for higher-ability students (Z = 114,023, p <lt; .001) and for foundation
   students (Z = 6,757, p <lt; .001). Again, higher-ability students have a
   greater level of genetics understanding before teaching, (W =
   349,326.5, p <lt; .001), and after teaching (W = 239,010.5, p <lt; .001) (Fig
   2).

   = 1,203, lower post: n = 284).

   Raw data can be found in S1 and S2 Data.

   A linked approach has been used again to further analyse the
   differences between ability groups. Both groups show a significant
   increase in genetics knowledge (higher: Z = 3,619.5, p <lt; .001, lower: Z
   = 6,149.5, p <lt; .001). There is a significant difference between the
   groups after teaching, with higher-ability students showing a greater
   understanding of genetics compared to those from lower-ability sets (W
   = 52,836.5, p <lt; .001), even when students start with the same
   understanding of genetics. This is confirmed by a comparison of the
   change in scores for each ability group (W = 35,224, p <lt; .001). ANCOVA
   predicting score change as a function of ability with pretest score as
   a covariate similarly finds an affect of ability (estimate 1.2, p
   <lt;0.0001). Again, this suggests that current teaching practices work
   best for the higher-ability students.

Teaching genetics first increases evolution knowledge

   Does the teaching order—genetics or evolution first—make a difference
   to learning outcome? Teaching has a positive impact on evolution
   knowledge for those students who are taught genetics first (Z = 42,704,
   p <lt; .001) and for those who are taught evolution first (Z = 23,566, p <lt;
   .001). The 2 groups are not significantly different prior to learning
   these topics (W = 302,352.2, p = 0.5.), but those students who were
   taught genetics first have significantly higher post-teaching test
   scores than those who were taught evolution first (W = 267,270, p <lt;
   .001). The change in scores was thus significantly different, with
   those learning genetics first showing a greater increase in evolution
   knowledge (W = 151,199.5, p <lt; .001) (Fig 3). This change reflects a
   mean difference of 0.4 marks, representing a 7% adjustment in
   understanding. A linked approach was also utilised and confirmed these
   findings: those students who learned genetics first showed a greater
   increase in evolution knowledge than those who learned evolution first
   (W = 166,702.5, p <lt; .001). Similarly, ANCOVA with change predicted as a
   function of order with pretest scores as a covariate find that genetics
   first improves scores most (estimate 0.35, p <lt; 0.0001). We note that
   these p values are robust to multitest correction. We note too that
   whether or not a teacher changed their order of teaching doesn’t
   predict the change in evolution knowledge (W = 70,474, p = 0.25).

Teaching genetics first is best for improving genetics knowledge

   Above, we have shown that teaching genetics first appears to lead to
   increased understanding of evolution. Does this come at a cost to
   improvement of genetics understanding? One could reasonably argue that
   there is no advantage to teaching genetics first if the net result is
   an increase in evolution knowledge but at a cost of genetics
   understanding. We find that, if anything, teaching genetics first
   increases both genetic and evolution understanding.

   Those taught using either topic order show an increase in genetics
   knowledge (genetics first: Z = 63,098, p <lt; .001, evolution first: Z =
   28,941, p <lt; .001). The 2 groups are, however, significantly different
   both before teaching (W = 428,985, p <lt; .001) and after (W = 352,946.5,
   p <lt; .001) in their genetics understanding. As they differed prior to
   teaching, a linked data approach was taken to compare students in the
   different tranches who had the same understanding prior to teaching.
   Again, students taught both topic orders show a significant increase in
   genetics understanding (genetics first: Z = 18,289, p <lt; .001 and
   evolution first: Z = 25,277, p <lt; .001), but those who learn about
   genetics first have significantly higher post-teaching test scores than
   those students who learn about evolution first (W = 173251, p <lt; .001).
   The change in scores is also significantly different, with those
   learning genetics first showing a greater increase in genetics
   knowledge (W = 129,838, p <lt; .001). The difference in change is 1.1
   marks, which represents a difference of 3.5%. Allowing for differences
   in pretest scores via an ANCOVA (change predicted as a function of
   order with pretest scores as a covariate) supports the value of
   teaching genetics first (estimate 1.32; p <lt; 0.0001; Fig 4). We note too
   that whether or not a teacher changed their normal order of teaching
   (if there was one) doesn’t predict the change in genetics knowledge (W
   = 76,988, p = 0.56).

   Here, we employ the subset of 4 pupils who completed all pre- and all
   postquestionanaires. Raw data can be found in S1 and S2 Data.

Acceptance of evolution

   Having seen that teaching has a positive impact on understanding of
   evolution and genetics, we now consider whether teaching has an impact
   on acceptance of evolution. We then consider whether student ability or
   the order in which topics are taught have any impact on evolution
   acceptance.

Teaching of evolution increases acceptance rates

   The majority of students are accepting of evolution, even before
   learning about the topic in secondary school. 78% of 1,712 students
   accept evolution before they have learned about it. Of the remaining
   students, 21% are undecided, and only 1% do not show acceptance towards
   evolution. This suggests that most students are open to learning about
   evolution in school (and indeed this was found within focus groups).
   Education has an overall positive impact on evolution acceptance. The
   proportion of 1,519 students who accept evolution increases to 85%,
   with only 14% of students undecided about evolution. 1% of students
   still have low acceptance. For definitions of acceptance
   categorisation, see Methods.

   In order to better understand the changes due to teaching, acceptance
   scores from individual students are compared. Overall, teaching has a
   small but highly significant positive impact on students’ acceptance of
   evolution (Z = 175,242.5, p <lt; .001) (Fig 1C). The average change in
   score is 2, which represents a 3% increase in acceptance. However,
   acceptance does not increase for all students: 2/3 demonstrate a
   positive change, 9% display no change, and 1/4 show a decrease in
   acceptance score. Not all of these changes involve marked differences,
   but it might be noteworthy that such a large proportion of students
   show some decrease in acceptance. Overall, we see that students that
   show larger increases in understanding of both genetics and evolution
   show larger increases in evolution acceptance (Spearman correlations:
   change in acceptance versus changes in genetics understanding: R[s] =
   0.1, p <lt; 0.0001; change in acceptance versus changes in evolution
   understanding: R[s] = 0.07, p = 0.013). There is no significant
   difference in the strength of these correlations (Monte Carlo
   simulation, p = 0.39). This supports the view that acceptance follows
   from increased understanding.

Higher-ability students have greater acceptance of evolution

   Teaching has a positive impact on acceptance of evolution for both
   higher-ability students (Z = 114,312, p <lt; .001) and foundation-ability
   groups of students (Z = 6,374.5, p <lt; .001). However, higher-ability
   students had a greater level of evolution acceptance before teaching
   than foundation-ability students (W = 325,619.5, p <lt; .001), as well as
   after teaching (W = 240,955.5, p <lt; .001) (Fig 5).

   Raw data can be found in S1 and S2 Data.

   Whether teaching makes a difference to acceptance that is different
   between the high- and foundation-ability students isn’t so clear. As
   these 2 groups were significantly different before teaching, a linked
   data approach was taken to further analyse a subsample of these data.
   Both groups show a significant increase in acceptance after teaching
   (higher: Z = 4,765, p <lt; .001, lower: Z = 6,337.5, p <lt; .001). While
   there is a significant difference between the groups after teaching
   with higher-ability students showing a greater acceptance of evolution,
   compared to those from lower-ability sets (W = 58,036, p = .03), this
   result is marginal and is sensitive to Bonferonni correction.
   Similarly, an effect of ability in score change is not found within an
   ANCOVA, in which change in score is predicted by ability controlling
   for pretest score (p for effect of ability, = 0.54).

Topic order has no impact on evolution acceptance

   Having shown that teaching order affects evolution understanding and
   that teaching increases evolution acceptance, we now ask whether
   teaching order affects evolution acceptance as would seem a logical
   corollary of these 2 prior results. Students taught evolution first and
   students taught genetics first both showed significant increase in
   evolution acceptance after teaching (genetics first: Z = 67,718, p <lt;
   .001, evolution first: Z = 25,183.5, p <lt; .001). However, these initial
   comparisons also revealed that the 2 groups were significantly
   different before they learned about evolution and genetics (W =
   377,746.5, p = .005), but not significantly different after learning
   about these topics (W = 289,152.5, p = .07). The reasons for this are
   unknown. A linked data approach was taken to compare students who had
   the same acceptance prior to teaching. There was no significant
   difference found between the different topics after teaching (W =
   168,338.5 p = .667), and the change in acceptance score is not
   predicted by teaching order in an ANCOVA (p = 0.85).

Acceptance of evolution is more strongly correlated with genetics
understanding than evolution understanding

   Given that teaching improves evolution acceptance and understanding,
   and teaching order makes a difference to evolution understanding, it is
   curious that we detect no order effect on evolution acceptance. One
   possible reason for this is that the correlation between evolution
   understanding and acceptance is weak, and hence a small difference in
   understanding (owing to topic order) translates into such a small
   incremental difference in acceptance as to be beyond our resolution,
   even with comparatively large sample sizes. We thus ask about the
   correlation between acceptance and understanding.

   Even before teaching, there is a moderate, positive relationship
   between evolution acceptance and genetics understanding (R[s] = 0.42 p
   <lt; .001). Importantly, there is a strikingly weaker positive
   relationship observed between evolution acceptance and evolution
   understanding (R[s] = 0.24 p <lt; .001) and between knowledge of genetics
   and knowledge of evolution (R[s] = 0.19, p <lt; .001). The correlation
   between genetics understanding and evolution acceptance is
   significantly stronger than that between evolution understanding and
   evolution acceptance (Monte Carlo simulation, p <lt; 0.0001). We conclude
   that, perhaps surprisingly, genetics understanding correlates better
   with evolution acceptance than evolution understanding does.

   In order to better understand the part knowledge plays in acceptance,
   partial correlations were calculated for the 2 principal variables. The
   correlation between evolution acceptance and genetics knowledge, given
   understanding of evolution, is rho = 0.39. The correlation between
   evolution acceptance and evolution knowledge, controlling for genetics
   knowledge, is only 0.18. Both results are highly significant (p <lt;
   .001). Again, the correlation between genetics knowledge and evolution
   acceptance appears to be stronger than that between evolution knowledge
   and evolution acceptance.

   Correlations after teaching between evolution acceptance, genetics
   understanding, and evolution understanding all appear similar to those
   seen prior to teaching. There is significant, robust positive
   correlation between acceptance of evolution and knowledge of genetics
   (R[s] = 0.41 p <lt; .001), between acceptance of evolution and knowledge
   of evolution (R[s] = 0.27 p <lt; .001), and between understanding of
   evolution and knowledge of genetics (R[s] = 0.39 p <lt; .001) after
   teaching (Fig 6) (Correlations of all pre- and postrelationships can be
   found in Table 1). Partial correlations, again, show very similar
   correlations as seen previously: the correlation between evolution
   acceptance and genetics knowledge, controlling for evolution knowledge,
   is stronger than that between evolution acceptance and evolution
   knowledge (Table 2). The correlation between genetics understanding and
   evolution acceptance is again significantly stronger than that between
   evolution understanding and evolution acceptance (Monte Carlo
   simulation, p <lt; 0.001).

   All correlations are highly significant (p <lt; .001). These pretests were

   all 3 assessments to be completed (n = 1,397). Raw data can be found in
   S1 and S2 Data.

   Here, we employ the subset of data for pupils who completed all pre-
   and all postquestionanaires. Regression lines are for indicative
   purposes alone. Raw data can be found in S1 and S2 Data.

   These results suggest that a unit increase in evolution understanding
   is likely to have only a very small incremental effect on evolution
   acceptance as the correlation between the 2 is weak both before and
   after teaching. Thus, it is logically possible that a small increment
   to evolution understanding (owing to order effects) translates as only
   a very small increase in the weakly-correlated evolution acceptance,
   too weak to be detectable by us. It is notable that the strongest
   relationship is seen between evolution acceptance and genetics
   knowledge. While causality here is unclear and may reflect little more
   than underlying ability, this we highlight as a most enigmatic result.
   It also lays the basis for the hypothesis that better understanding of
   genetics may be an optimal strategy, if the desired end is increase in
   both evolution understanding and evolution acceptance. This, we
   suggest, is worthy of further scrutiny.

Qualitative analysis suggests authority conditions acceptance

   Our results show the positive impact on evolution understanding that
   teaching has and factors that impact this—most importantly, topic
   order. Teaching also has a positive impact on acceptance. Why, then,
   might acceptance and understanding be so poorly correlated? Qualitative
   data collected from focus groups suggest that not what is taught, but
   who evolution is taught by, is more important for acceptance. Many
   students were happy to admit that they accept evolution because it’s
   what they had been told by their parents or taught by their teachers,
   although a few students acknowledged that this is something most people
   tend to do when they are young:

     “Because that’s what we’ve been told […] that’s what I believe.”

     —(Year 10 student)

     “I was told by my parents when I was younger because you believe
     what your parents say when you’re young.”

     —(Year 10 student)

     “I don’t think that we’re being lied to at all […] I just don’t
     think it’s like a conspiracy theory.”

     —(Year 9 student)

     “I don’t know if there is such evidence [for evolution], we’ve just
     been told that this is right.”

     —(Year 9 student)

   Important figures were not just people that students knew. Television
   documentaries were commonly given as a source of information about
   evolution, and some students felt these, and their presenters, were
   important in helping them accept evolution:

     “Even in like TV programmes they make it really convincing as well.”

     —(Year 11 student)

     “Well, if David Attenborough believes in it then why shouldn’t
     everyone else?”

     —(Year 10 student)

   The use of “belief” as opposed to “accept” is common among students,
   perhaps indicating lack of understanding of differences between science
   and religion. The importance of religious beliefs was clearly important
   for some students, with some envisaging that they should pick “either
   one or the other.” But here, knowledge of authority figures within
   their religion was also important:

     “I’m religious so that’s why I kind of find it difficult […] the
     first lesson I kind of—I kind of wanted to argue that actually God
     put everyone there but then I kind of also believe in science a lot
     so I was really confused the first lesson but—but then Miss was like
     ‘Oh yeah, the Pope actually agrees with some of the theories behind
     it’ so I kind of accepted it but don’t strongly believe in it […] I
     kind of just accepted because the Pope kind of believed in some of
     the theories that I could as well.”

     —(Year 10 student)

   This student had initially felt uncomfortable about learning evolution
   due to their religious beliefs, but having the knowledge that their
   religion accepted evolution was of importance. It ensured that they
   were able to learn about evolution and not cause any disruption to the
   class. It could be argued that there are underlying issues here and
   that, ideally, students should have a better understanding of the
   nature of science and its differences from religion. However, if this
   simple teacher intervention can ensure religious students are more
   comfortable and open to learning about evolution, this may appear a
   defensible approach to take.

Teaching genetics first improves understanding for students of all abilities

   Given the key findings regarding topic order, combined with the strong
   evidence found that ability has a big impact on evolution acceptance
   and evolution and genetics understanding, it is important to ask
   whether the topic order effect observed in the previous section is
   independent of ability. This is for 2 reasons. First, there is the
   purely statistical concern that if high-ability students show more
   improvement and more of such students learned genetics first, the
   trends seen need not be explained in terms of order effects. Second,
   teaching high-ability students is often not so much of a challenge,
   while finding effective mechanisms to teach the lower-ability classes
   can be challenging. To address both these issues, we analyse the order
   effects stratified by ability.

   A comparison of the proportion of higher- and foundation-ability
   students within the 2 topic orders can be found in Table 3. From this,
   it is clear that, for reasons unknown, foundation-ability students
   tended to be taught evolution first. To address the statistical concern
   as well as the pedagogical concern, analysis is therefore needed to
   distinguish the impact of topic order from that of ability. The
   different topic orders for both higher- and foundation-ability groups
   have therefore been compared.

Teaching genetics first is best for increasing evolution knowledge for both
higher- and foundation-ability students

   Higher-ability students show significant increase in evolution
   understanding regardless of which topic order they are taught first
   (genetics first: Z = 33,239.5, p <lt; .001, evolution first: Z = 15,882.5,
   p = .004). The 2 order groups were not significantly different before
   teaching (W = 195,495.5, p = .7), but higher-ability students who
   learned about genetics first demonstrate greater evolution knowledge
   after teaching than those who were taught evolution first (W =
   1,777,056.5, p = .005). Similarly, there is a significant difference
   between the change in scores, with those taught genetics first showing
   the greater increase in knowledge of evolution (Fig 7.; W = 178,140, p
   = 1.4 x 10^−5). The difference in change was, on average, a 6.4%
   increase in knowledge of evolution.

   Fig 7
   Change in understanding of evolution due to teaching for higher-ability
   students taught genetics first (n = 683) and evolution first (n = 372)
   and for foundation-ability students taught genetics first (n = 93) and
   evolution first (n = 79).

   Data plotted here is for the subset of the data in which all students
   answered all pre- and postquestionnaires. Raw data can be found in S1
   and S2 Data.

   Perhaps most striking, we find that within the foundation-ability
   students, only those that were taught genetics first saw a significant
   increase in evolution understanding (genetics first: Z = 599, p <lt; .001,
   evolution first: Z = 758, p = 0.9). Those who learned about genetics
   first showed a greater increase in understanding compared to those who
   were taught evolution first (Fig 7; W = 24,172, p = 0.025, sensitive to
   Bonferonni correction). This represents a difference of about 9% in
   change in scores.

   In addition, we performed a multivariate regression to predict change
   in evolution, understanding scores with ability and topic order as
   factors, and pretest score as a covariate. This reveals that both topic
   order (estimate 0.34, p <lt; 0.001) and ability (estimate 0.28, p =
   0.0065) are predictors, as discussed above, with genetics first being
   beneficial.

Teaching genetics first increases genetics knowledge for higher- and
foundation-ability students

   As mentioned before, it is important to ascertain whether the teaching
   of genetics first comes at a cost to poorer increased understanding of
   genetics. We find that teaching genetics first appears to improve
   genetics understanding for both ability groups. Higher-ability students
   show a significant increase in genetics understanding regardless of
   which topic order they are taught first (genetics first: Z = 45,985, p
   <lt; .001, evolution first: Z = 15,202.5, p <lt; .001). However, the 2 groups
   are significantly different before (W = 263,571.5, p <lt; .001) and after
   (W = 222,113.5, p <lt; .001) teaching. Therefore, a linked data approach
   has been utilised to further investigate these changes. Again, both
   linked groups show a significant increase in knowledge (genetics first:
   Z = 10,050, p <lt; .001, evolution first: Z = 13,372, p <lt; .001). There is
   a significant difference between the 2 groups after teaching (W =
   91,467.5, p <lt; 0.001) with those who learned about genetics first having
   higher post-teaching scores than those who were taught evolution first.
   Those who learned genetics first also show a greater increase in
   knowledge than those taught evolution first (W = 70,724.5, p = .002),
   supported also by ANCOVA (estimate 1.2, p = 1.4 x 10^−7).

   Foundation-ability students also show a significant increase in
   genetics understanding regardless of which topic order they are taught
   first (genetics first: Z = 1,342, p <lt; .001, evolution first: Z =
   2,099.5, p <lt; .001). The 2 groups were not significantly different
   before teaching (W = 16,048.5, p = .97), but foundation-ability
   students who learned about genetics first demonstrated greater genetics
   knowledge than those who were taught evolution first (W = 12,162, p =
   .002). There was a significant difference between the change in scores
   with those taught genetics first showing the greater change in
   knowledge of genetics (W = 7,933.5, p = .03; sensitive to multitest
   correction) and is supported by ANCOVA (estimate 2.0, p = 0.006). The
   average increase represents a 5% increase in knowledge of genetics.

   In addition, we performed a multivariate regression to predict change
   in genetics understanding scores with ability and topic order as
   factors and pretest score as a covariate. This reveals that both topic
   order (estimate 1.3, p <lt; 0.0001) and ability (estimate = 1.2, p =
   0.0001) are predictors as discussed above, with genetics first being
   beneficial.

Topic order has no impact on evolution acceptance in both ability groups

   Above, we found no significant effect of topic order on evolution
   acceptance. Does this apply to both ability groups? Higher-ability
   students taught either topic order show a significant increase in
   evolution acceptance (genetics first: Z = 47,143.5, p <lt; .001, evolution
   first: Z = 14,699, p <lt; .001). The 2 groups are significantly different
   before learning about evolution and genetics (W = 228,160, p = .01) but
   are similar after teaching (W = 179,555, p = .05). A linked approach is
   again used and again finds that both groups show a significant increase
   in knowledge after teaching (genetics first: Z = 12,390.5, p <lt; .001,
   evolution first: Z = 14,552, p <lt; .001). There is no significant
   difference between the post-teaching scores of the 2 groups (W =
   91,474, p = .06), nor is there any difference in the amount of change
   between the 2 topic orders (W = 78,153, p = .06).

   Similarly, foundation-ability students show a significant increase in
   acceptance of evolution, regardless of topic order (genetics first: Z =
   1,822, p <lt; .001, evolution first: Z = 1,370, p <lt; .001). The 2 groups
   are not significantly different before (W = 14,718.5, p = .1) or after
   (W = 10,405.5, p = .05) teaching. There was also no significant
   difference in the amount of change between the 2 order groups (W =
   6,856.5, p = .1). In addition, we performed a multivariate regression
   to predict change in evolution acceptance scores with ability and topic
   order as factors and pretest score as a covariate. This reveals that
   neither topic order (p <lt; 0.88) nor ability (p = 0.55) are predictors.

   In summary, findings related to topic order are not due to covariance
   with ability of students and, crucially, teaching genetics first helps
   both ability groups with no detriment to genetics understanding. That
   is to say, teaching genetics first increases understanding of evolution
   and genetics for both higher- and foundation-ability students. Topic
   order appears to have no impact on evolution acceptance, regardless of
   academic ability.

Teaching has long lasting effects on acceptance and understanding

   The previous results have all compared understanding and acceptance
   immediately before and after students have learned about evolution and
   genetics. In order to better understand what happens after time has
   lapsed since teaching, we ask whether students retain this knowledge
   and level of acceptance. This is an important consideration: if
   students show an increase in knowledge immediately after teaching, but
   then return to their preteaching level a few months later, it could be
   argued that education is not successful. Unfortunately, our sample size
   is too low to say anything meaningful about whether topic order has any
   effects on longer-term retention or to stratify this by ability.

   These data are purely a subsection of all data: pre- and postdata are
   only included for classes that completed a retention test (therefore,
   numbers and statistical tests may vary slightly from results reported
   previously). The timing of the retention test varied between classes
   but was generally 3 to 6 months after these topics were taught, and did
   not correspond to any revision or examination of evolution or genetics.
   For many students, secondary school may be the last (if not only) time
   they learn about evolution. The responses found within these retention
   tests may therefore be representative of students’ lasting thoughts and
   understandings of these topics.

   Although a smaller cohort, the subsection of students who completed the
   questionnaire retention test are not significantly different from the
   larger student sample whose questionnaire results are reported
   previously. They also show the same trend of significant increases in
   acceptance and understanding immediately after teaching, as were seen
   in students sampled previously, and are thus thought to be
   representative of the larger sample.

   Teaching has a positive and long-term impact on evolution acceptance,
   genetics understanding, and evolution understanding. As previously
   observed, students show significant increase in acceptance and
   understanding immediately after learning about evolution and genetics
   (evolution acceptance: Z = 8,749.5, p <lt; .001; genetics understanding: Z
   = 8,574.5, p <lt; .001; evolution understanding: Z = 8,269, p <lt; .001).
   Perhaps surprisingly, evolution acceptance and evolution understanding
   have not changed significantly by the time of the retention test
   (evolution acceptance: Z = 16,879, p = .63; evolution understanding: Z
   = 7,479; p = .054). Genetics understanding decreased significantly
   between the post-teaching and retention tests (Z = 12,560.5, p <lt; .048).
   However, understanding at the point of the retention test is still
   significantly higher than that prior to teaching (Z = 5,196.5, p <lt;
   .001). These results are all shown in Fig 1.

No evidence for intraclass underdispersion (teacher effects)

   Above, we have performed all analyses at the level of the student,
   ignoring possible nonindependence between data owing to the fact that
   the class has the same teacher (although this wasn’t always true). If
   any such effect is confounding our analysis, we should see lower
   intraclass variation in changes in scores than expected. In the most
   extreme circumstance, we expect all students under an “excellent”
   teacher to show equally large changes in scores, while those under a
   less competent teacher would show equally little changes in scores.
   Thus, in both incidences, at the limit, the intraclass variance in the
   change in scores would be zero.

   To investigate this possibility, we calculate for each class (with more
   than 2 students reporting before and after data) the normalised
   intraclass variance in change. As we are concerned with the magnitude
   of the variation independent of the between-class variation in mean
   change, we normalise by the intraclass mean to calculate the dispersion
   index, which equals variance within class in change divided by mean
   class change. The overall reporting statistic is the mean of all the
   per-class dispersion index values.

   To determine whether the observed mean dispersion is lower than
   expected, we perform a nonparametric Monte Carlo simulation. We then
   take each student again and randomly allocate a change score, the
   values being taken from those used to calculate the real mean
   dispersion. The random allocation is done without replacement, so each
   change score is used once in the real data and once in each
   randomization. For each Monte Carlo simulation, we then repeat the
   above analysis to generate a mean dispersion for all pseudoclasses
   (note that class structure is maintained intact, thus also controlling
   for class size effects).

   If there were a teacher-effect causing nonindependence between data
   (i.e., under dispersion), we expect to see a lower mean dispersion in
   the real data than in randomized data (at the limit, all students
   within any given class go up or down to the same degree, dispersion = 0
   as variance = 0). The significance of any reduction will be given by p
   = (n+1)/(m+1), where n is the number of randomizations in which the
   randomized dispersion is lower than or as low as that observed in the
   real data (i.e., a 1-tailed expectation). We ran each simulation 10,000
   times for each of the 3 scores measures. In no case did we observe
   anything even approaching a significantly lower mean dispersion than
   expected by chance (evolution acceptance, p = 0.77; evolution
   knowledge, p = 0.56; genetics knowledge, p = 0.22). To check that this
   wasn’t an artefact of high variance when there are few recorded
   samples, we reanalysed requiring a minimum of 6 change calculations per
   class. We again find no evidence for underdispersion (evolution
   acceptance, p = 0.78; evolution knowledge, p = 0.58; genetics
   knowledge, p = 0.17). Analysing each of the 3 questions stratified into
   high and low groups similarly finds no evidence for underdispersion
   (even though the test is 1-tailed and not multitest corrected, Pmin =
   0.12, Pmax = 0.82). We conclude that we see no evidence that dispersion
   within classes is lower than expected under a null random model and
   thus consider both that we see no teacher-effects and that it is
   appropriate to analyse at the level of the student.

Class-level analysis supports the utility of teaching genetics first

   While the above result indicates that analysis at the student level is
   appropriate, it is also helpful to ask whether a much more conservative
   class-level analysis provides any support for the hypothesis that
   teaching genetics first improves evolution understanding. To address
   this, we calculated for each class a mean change (post score −
   prescore) for each of the 3 parameters (acceptance and understanding x
   2). We then performed Mann Whitney U tests for each of the 3
   parameters, comparing those classes taught evolution first with those
   taught genetics first.

   Even though the sample sizes are much more restricted than in the
   student-focused analysis (just 70 classes in which we have at least 1
   student doing all the pre tests and all the post tests), nonetheless we
   see that teaching genetics first significantly improves evolution
   understanding (p = 0.004), with the mean class increase in score being
   approximately double that of the evolution-first treatment (Table 4).
   Stratifying this by ability leads to an even more conservative test, as
   we have only 18 qualifying foundation-ability classes. Even in this
   stratification, however, we still see that teaching genetics first
   improves evolution understanding compared to the opposite order,
   although the effect is significant only in the larger sample size
   high-ability class (p = 0.006), where “genetics-first” changes in
   scores are over 2.5 times greater than with evolution-first (Table 4).
   In the foundation-ability class, evolution understanding change scores
   are improved in the genetics-first order, but not significantly so.
   This may be a sample size issue, as with only 9 classes in each
   partition we couldn’t likely detect a 5%–10% effect even if there were
   one. We see no evidence that genetics understanding is adversely
   affected by being taught first (Table 4) and, again, no evidence that
   evolution acceptance is affected by ordering (Table 4).

Discussion

   Our results suggest that, at least in the UK setting, teaching of
   evolution and genetics is in a constructive position. Teaching improves
   understanding and acceptance, these increases showing strong signs of
   longer-term retention. Overall, evolution acceptance is high among the
   diverse secondary school students that we sampled, increasing to 85%
   after teaching. This being said, some students spoke in the focus
   groups of expecting there to be more evidence for evolution than was
   presented in their lessons, this suggesting possible improvements.

   Most importantly, topic order is implicated in increasing understanding
   of these topics: students who are taught genetics before evolution have
   significantly greater knowledge of evolution and genetics, compared to
   students who are taught evolution first. Importantly, this same
   strategy appears not to be to the detriment of genetics understanding,
   which, if anything, is also improved by teaching genetics first. This
   suggests a simple, cost-free, minimally disruptive process to improve
   evolution understanding: namely, teaching genetics first. Importantly,
   too, for the foundation-ability students, only if genetics was taught
   first do we see an improvement in evolution knowledge. Given that there
   is so little cost in such a change, even if the results of our analysis
   were to prove not to be replicable, we can see little-to-no downside of
   this small switch in teaching practice. Given that teaching genetics
   first appears to be the only strategy that improves evolution
   understanding for those of foundation ability, we suggest that it might
   be negligent not to adopt this practice. Given, too, the strong
   correlation between genetics understanding and evolution acceptance, an
   optimal method to improve understanding of genetics and evolution, as
   well as to improve evolution acceptance, may be to concentrate more
   effort into the teaching of the genetic concepts that underpin the
   mechanisms of evolutionary change.

Why might order matter?

   The above results fit within the broader context of notions that order
   is important for learning, be that student learning or artificial
   intelligence learning [57], and that the importance of such effects is
   underappreciated [57], not least because of the dearth of empirical
   evidence [57]. Our study design was not focused on understanding why
   the order might help so much as whether the order helps. Nonetheless,
   we can speculate. The ordering effects could be owing to conceptual
   priming [58], the notion that exposure to one concept makes one more or
   less receptive to a subsequent stimulus, although there may well be
   more than 1 underlying mechanism [59]. This then would be different
   from the rationale as to why the ordering of the use of analogy works,
   as this appears rather to be owing to analogical mapping [60], not
   conceptual priming. While our motivation for this project was largely
   inspired by the possibility of conceptual priming, a possibly
   synergistic explanation might be that, as nearly all of the material
   needed to understand allele frequency change is front loaded under the
   banner of genetics and not under the banner of evolution, the core
   foundational concepts were absorbed in a context that mitigates
   belief-associated cognitive biases (e.g., confirmation bias [61]). That
   is to say, the foundational concepts (DNA, mutation, inheritance,
   alleles) are uncontroversial and should be easily absorbed when
   presented under the umbrella of genetics. Once accepted, the
   cognititive dissonance [62] associated with processing information
   under the banner “evolution” might be considerably lessened, as the
   student has only one bit of information to process—alleles can change
   frequency—which, additionally, follows as a logical consequence
   (conceptual priming) of the material absorbed without confirmation
   bias. Consistent with this, we found in qualitative data numerous
   examples of students anxious about learning evolution because of their
   religious beliefs, indicative of possible cognitive dissonance.

   If the second explanation is correct, it might be best to teach
   material that is evolution under the banner “genetics” or “population
   genetics.” This “evolution by stealth” strategy could be tested by
   presenting the same “genetics first, evolution second” material under
   different banners. In the control, the students would be told
   explicitly that they are now switching to studying “evolution” and in
   the second, they would be told explicitly that they are now switching
   to studying “population genetics.” If the result is owing to any of the
   above cognitive biases (rather than something peculiar about the
   classroom situation), then the same “genetics first” intervention may
   well be profitable if employed at different educational levels (e.g.,
   first year university level) and also in public engagement.

Why is evolution understanding and acceptance weakly coupled?

   Teaching evolution and genetics results in a significant increase in
   evolution acceptance, regardless of teaching order. While the “genetics
   first” option had demonstrable effects on evolution understanding, the
   same was not true for evolution acceptance. This could be explained (in
   statistical terms) as a consequence of a decoupling of evolutionary
   knowledge from acceptance of evolution. After partial correlation
   control, we report a correlation between evolution understanding and
   evolution acceptance of R = 0.18, making R^2 just ~3% (Table 2). That
   is to say, variation in one parameter explains only 3% of the variation
   in the other. As a consequence, assuming a causal arrow between
   understanding and acceptance, a small but detectable increase in
   evolution understanding owing to teaching order is expected to have, at
   most, a miniscule effect on increased evolution acceptance, so
   miniscule as to be beyond the resolution of this study, despite its
   relatively large sample sizes.

   Our qualitative analysis suggests coherent reasons for the decoupling
   of evolution understanding, not least of which is what might be
   considered “authority.” For students of a religious background, this
   appeared to be of some importance, as might be expected given the prior
   literature on religious-based impediments to acceptance of evolution in
   numerous contexts. Anecdotally, it appears that simple statements
   concerning the acceptance of evolution by key religious authority
   figures, prior to teaching, may enable some students to approach
   evolution as they would any other science. However, the data here are
   anecdotal.

   The dislocation between acceptance and understanding also underscores
   the need to consider acceptance and understanding/knowledge as 2
   distinct parameters. In addition, in this context we note that although
   the terms knowledge and understanding have been used synonymously,
   there is a difference. While students might have knowledge of a topic,
   they may not really understand it. Perhaps a better distinction between
   these terms would provide more insight into relationships with
   acceptance. Discussions with students would suggest that they know
   evidence for evolution exists, yet few are able to describe any of this
   evidence in any detail or even give examples. They appear to have
   limited understanding of evidence. However, these students are still
   accepting of evolution. This also leads to the question, what is known?
   Are there particular areas of genetics or evolution knowledge that
   provoke evolution acceptance? Or, indeed, are there specific aspects of
   genetics knowledge that enrich evolution knowledge?

Are we teaching foundation classes appropriately?

   While teaching genetics first was the only order in which the
   foundation students improved understanding of evolution, one possible
   source of concern in our results is the consistency with which teaching
   improves scores for higher-ability students more than it does for
   foundation-ability students. In some cases, we see that teaching
   possibly has a negative impact on foundation-ability students. Some of
   the latter may be owing to stochastic fluctuation and is, thus, not of
   concern. We also cannot fully eliminate the possibility of the bored
   student. However, the greater response of the high-ability students
   cannot be easily dismissed as, if anything, we expect there to be a
   “ceiling effect” of the questionnaire, in which those that demonstrate
   high acceptance or knowledge prior to teaching cannot increase all that
   much (put differently, you can’t score more than 100%).

   One hypothesis to address these observations is that, despite the fact
   that “genetics first” was the only strategy that led to improvements of
   evolution understanding for the foundation-ability group, what works
   for the teaching of high-ability students may not be optimal for
   foundation students. This in turns suggests the possibility of
   tailoring teaching to ability, as, for example, is done in mathematics.
   Whether this means a simple intervention such as slower teaching (and
   slower more reinforced introduction of new concepts), or different
   approaches to the teaching, will require considerable further analysis,
   far beyond the scope of the current analysis. Evident hypotheses for
   further scrutiny include the possibility that higher-ability students
   tend to have higher logical reasoning skills. Alternatively, might
   higher-ability students be any more or less likely to have alternative
   prior beliefs, compared to lower-ability students?

Caveats

   Given the imperfect nature of school-level interventions, our study
   naturally comes with multiple caveats. Our strategy was to randomise
   ordering of teaching between teachers and to have enough teachers in
   each group as to discount any effect of the individual teacher, cohort
   or class. That is to say, had we just employed 2 classes we would not
   have been able to say if any effect was owing to the ordering rather
   than owing to the teacher. The premise of our design was to assume that
   with enough different teachers and classes, for every exceptional
   teacher teaching evolution first, there would be an equally exceptional
   one teaching genetics first. It remains a possibility that the
   genetics-first effect was owing to especially good teachers being, by
   chance, randomised into the genetics first class. Such is the problem
   of all randomisations. However, we also see the genetics-first effects
   in both ability partitions (when analysed at the student level). If the
   core result were a failure of randomisation, it is a failure that has
   occurred in both independent subgroups. Moreover, we see no evidence
   for underdispersion, suggesting that teacher effects are not an
   important issue.

   What we can be more confident about is that there exists no bias owing
   to teachers teaching in their preferred and practiced manner, as
   teachers didn’t get to select the order that they might teach in
   (teaching order was handed down from the head of sciences or biology in
   each school). Those teachers that switched order had no lesser impact
   on change scores than those that didn’t. Some schools couldn’t,
   however, be properly randomised, because they were constrained as to
   order (e.g., they needed more advanced warning to buy in resources).
   However, there appear to be as many who taught evolution first as
   taught genetics first, so we don’t expect this to be a major issue.
   Nonetheless, this constraint means that our trial isn’t of the strict
   standards of medical randomised control trials in which there are no
   constraints as to which treatment each recipient is exposed to.
   Moreover, unlike a medical trial in which there is a treatment and a
   control, this study permits no control, as it would be unethical to not
   teach students material they would need in exams. By contrast, as the
   teachers had to teach the material anyway, we have no evidence of
   teacher drop out after ordering was chosen (in drug trials, patients
   can show biased profiles of dropout). There are multiple other issues
   of sampling (e.g., we invited all schools within a given area, but the
   responding schools may be a biased subset) that also are less than
   optimal, but unavoidable as well. We consider these and other details
   of the implementation of the experimental design in S1 Text.

Methods

Ethical considerations and data protection

   The project was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of
   Biology and Biochemistry of the University of Bath. Ethical guidelines
   as prescribed by The British Educational Research Education [63] have
   been followed. Particular consideration has been taken when working
   with school students, and approaches that place any undue burden on
   participants have been avoided. Research through questionnaires and
   focus groups has taken place within students’ schools and have involved
   students’ usual science teachers so as to minimise undue intrusion.
   Additional information including that on consent forms can be found in
   the supplementary materials (method for obtaining consent to fill
   questionnaires: S2 Text; questionnaire consent form: S3 Text; method
   for group consent: S4 Text; focus group permission form: S5 Text; focus
   group consent form: S6 Text).

Statement of hypothesis

   We consider 3 hypotheses:

   The null hypothesis (HO): there is no difference in terms of student
   response between the genetics-then-evolution and the
   evolution-then-genetics sequences.

   The positive hypothesis (H+): there is an advantage in terms of student
   response for genetics-then-evolution sequence over
   evolution-then-genetics sequence.

   The negative hypothesis (H−): there is an advantage in terms of student
   response for evolution-then-genetics over genetics-then-evolution
   sequence.

   Student response we define in 3 dimensions: understanding of evolution,
   understanding of genetics, and acceptance of evolution. In terms of the
   student response regarding genetics understanding, we had no prior
   supposition that order would affect its understanding and so there is
   no directionality in the test of deviation from null. Effect sizes are
   expressed as percent difference in increments in scores between
   treatments. Our design may be considered a revised version of a
   crossover design [56].

Statement of intent and design

   In trials of this nature, one might suspect that when the test is done,
   a significant effect of any variety is searched for and a story told
   about the significant effect. In this context, we wish to state that
   the study design and intent were lodged with the funders, the evolution
   Education Trust in March 2011, the project starting several months
   after. The project title was “The teaching of evolution and genetics:
   an investigation into the place of knowledge about genetics in
   accepting the theory of evolution by natural selection.”

   The aim of the project was stipulated thus:

   “The structure of the design of the experiment controls for the
   material presented and allows rigorous evaluation of the hypothesis
   that ‘front-loading’ the genetics component makes a difference. By
   comparing the understanding of evolution and genetics before and after
   the presentation of the packages, we shall be able to determine whether
   the order of presentation of the genetics-related information has an
   effect on the probability that a student has improved understanding.”

   The full statement of design is available from the funders by
   contacting the director: Michael Magnay, Church House, Marston St
   Lawrence, Banbury, Oxon, OX17 2DA, United Kingdom.

Modifications after pilot

   The experimental design permitted a pilot study and initial
   consultation with teachers. From this, we chose to a) allow teachers to
   teach material as they preferred in a manner specific to their exam
   board (rather than obliging them to teach a preprepared package) and b)
   to maximize the sample size within the limit of time available. The
   former option was chosen, as it became clear that teachers would not
   adopt a significant change to their teaching practice and were the
   project to realise an order effect (in either direction), then its
   implementation would be simpler if no change to teaching material was
   required. Thus, we do not control for material presented.

   In addition, we chose to nest the study in a survey of survey of
   understanding of 14–16-year-old UK school childrens’ understanding and
   acceptance of evolution prior to any teaching (as here reported). For
   this, samples sizes in the thousands are the norm, and this informed
   the choice to maximize. As a priori, the students have to be taught
   both streams (genetics and evolution) and no information was available
   to say if either might be better, we presumed no harm. Thus, no power
   calculation was performed. For considerations of the ideal and
   constraints on design and mode of randomisation, please consult S1
   Text. Randomisation was left to heads of science or biology, and no
   teacher was permitted to choose their order. Not all schools could
   alter order (e.g., because they to have to order in supplies for
   teaching particular lessons), so this project falls short of a full
   randomisation.

Student questionnaire

   Quantitative data were collected through a student questionnaire to
   determine acceptance of evolution and understanding of genetics and
   evolution. This was devised for GCSE-level students (14–16-year-olds)
   who study evolution and genetics as part of their science GCSE science
   course. An advantage of analysis of this age group is that order
   effects may well be most easily detected if there has been little or no
   priming. While primary school children in the UK are presently expected
   to be taught basic genetics and evolution on the national curriculum,
   this is a recent introduction and the cohort we analysed did not have
   this exposure. Indeed, this academic stage was chosen as it is
   currently the first, and perhaps only, period at which students have to
   learn about evolution. This cohort is not self-selecting in the way
   that a higher academic stage might be. For example, students aged from
   16–18 and studying for a Biology A-Level qualification will already
   have achieved a reasonable standard of academic achievement in science
   to enrol in this, and presumably have an interest for biology, or would
   not have chosen to study the subject further. Therefore, in choosing to
   study GCSE-level students, this research has involved a wide variety of
   students, in terms of academic ability and interest in evolution and
   science.

   Where possible, the student questionnaire was used at 3 times:
     * Pretest—prior to learning both genetics and evolution;
     * Post-test—immediately after learning of both topics;
     * Retention test—approximately 3 to 6 months after the teaching of
       the topics (but not coinciding with any revision or examination of
       topics).

   Most schools continued to teach these topics as normal, with existing
   variation, such as topic order, being comparative between classes
   without further intervention. However, some schools were also asked to
   make changes to their normal teaching, such as to change the order in
   which evolution and genetics were taught, and/or to include an activity
   which linked the 2 topics. Due to the time constraints of teaching exam
   specifications and limited flexibility within some school schemes of
   work, there was no pressure placed on teachers to change their normal
   teaching sequence or include different resources.

   The questionnaire consists of 25 questions: 13 focus on acceptance of
   evolution (Section A), 6 on genetics knowledge (Section B), and 6 on
   evolution knowledge (Section C). None of the questions involve extended
   writing and are all variations of the multiple-choice question. These
   types of questions were chosen for their practicalities: to aid student
   completion time, to avoid instances of not being able to understand
   transcriptions, to allow for quantitative analysis of data, and that
   this method is commonly used in similar studies (e.g., [49]).

   At all stages of the questionnaire development, including a pilot
   study, evolution and education experts were consulted from the
   University of Bath along with practising teachers. The questionnaire
   was designed with time constraints in mind: teachers consulted during
   its development were insistent that the questionnaire must be short
   enough so that its completion would not considerably reduce their
   lesson time. Ten to 15 minutes was considered an appropriate length.
   The final questionnaires are presented in S7 Text.

evolution acceptance

   Section A assesses students’ opinions towards evolution and consists of
   13 Likert Scale items. These were based largely on the Measure of
   Acceptance of the Theory of evolution (MATE), which was developed to
   assess biology teachers’ acceptance of evolution [64] and later,
   undergraduate students’ acceptance of evolution [65]. The original MATE
   instrument consists of 20 items spread disproportionately across 6
   subsections of evolutionary concepts or aspects. It was decided that
   this was too long for school students. Appropriate questions were
   chosen based on their relevance to these different aspects of evolution
   and their accessibility to school-aged students. Given that the MATE
   has been developed and tested predominately on teachers and
   undergraduate students (e.g., [49,66]), some modifications to the
   language used were needed. Where necessary, statements were reworded to
   make them more understandable. Two items were also based on Lovely and
   Konderick’s study [67] into undergraduate opinions of evolution. This
   section was found to be reliable through internal consistency checks
   (alpha 0.82, G6 0.83).

Acceptance categorisation

   Student acceptance is categorised based on acceptance scores. Scores
   for individual items are measured on a scale of 1 to 5, corresponding
   to “very high acceptance,” “high acceptance,” “undecided,” “low
   acceptance,” or “very low acceptance” of evolution. Students receive a
   total score of between 13 and 65 (a higher score represents a higher
   acceptance of evolution). The acceptance categories referred to here
   are an amalgamation of the 2 “high” and “low” acceptance categories
   (“undecided” remains unchanged) as detailed in Table 5. This is based
   on work by Nadelson and Sinatra [68] to describe MATE categories (after
   [69]).

   High                46–65

Genetics knowledge

   Section B consists of 6 questions which focus on knowledge of genetics.
   This includes variations on questions from recent GCSE exams,
   questionnaires used in the Genetics Literacy Assessment Instrument
   (GLAI) for undergraduates [70], and questions from [71] in their study
   of school students’ understanding of genetics. Two of these questions
   involve choosing or ordering key words from lists provided, and one
   question involves ticking boxes. These types of questions were chosen
   to gain greater insight into students’ ideas on living organisms and
   genetics and to add variety to the questionnaire for students.

evolution knowledge

   Section C focuses on evolution knowledge and consists of 6 questions.
   This section includes a variety of different aspects of evolution,
   including natural selection and geological time. Most of these were
   variations of questions used by Rutledge and Warden [49] in their
   research into acceptance and understanding of evolution among high
   school biology teachers. Additionally, a number of questions were
   devised with the assistance of evolution experts. Each question was
   scored equally with a section total out of 6.

Data overview

   Table 6 gives an overview of responses collected from the student
   questionnaire. These were collected from a total of 78 classes within
   23 different schools between September 2012 and September 2015. The
   data collection was terminated in order to enable analysis of results
   within the funding period. In total, 1,886 students completed the
   questionnaire at least once. Table 7 shows the numbers of students
   associated with key variables to be investigated, namely ability and
   topic order. Although 3,572 questionnaires have been received in total,
   there is a large amount of variation in the number of pre-, post-, and
   retention tests completed, as can be seen in Table 6. Individual
   students have been omitted from certain analyses, e.g., those comparing
   pre- and post-test, where students were absent at the time one of these
   questionnaires was completed. Data have been used where possible, as
   there is still value in students’ responses at a single point in time,
   even if it has not been possible to compare paired data longitudinally.
   Sample sizes therefore differ considerably for different analyses.

Focus groups

   Focus groups were designed to better understand the responses found in
   the student questionnaires, i.e., why students were or were not
   accepting of evolution; how these views related to knowledge of
   evolution; how these related to knowledge of genetics; and what other
   factors are important. Seventy-six students were involved in 16 focus
   groups. These students were from 10 different schools. The largest
   focus groups contained 7 students and the smallest, 2. All students
   were from groups identified as “higher-ability,” with most students
   being from among the top sets in each school. The majority of students
   were in Years 9, 10, and 11 and studying towards their GCSE
   examinations. Six students were in Year 12 and studying for A-Level
   exams. Most focus groups comprised students of the same age and from
   the same class, however there were 3 groups which contained a mixture
   of ages and classes.

Background information

   A mixture of state, faith, and independent schools have been involved
   in this project. All schools are from the South of England and Mid and
   South Wales. All are English language schools. Schools included
   students from socially and economically diverse communities, including
   rural, suburban, and inner city. A number of schools are single-sex.
   Although data were not collected specifically on student demographics,
   a wide range of ethnic backgrounds and faiths were represented.
   Background data on schools have been collected from inspection
   (OFSTED/ESTYN) reports, school websites, and from meetings with
   teachers. These can be found in the S1 Data and S1 Text.

Statistics

   All statistics were conducted in R, via purpose-written Tcl scripts or
   in JMP. No change in score data was normally distributed (Shapiro test
   p <lt; 10^−16 in all cases), and we were unable to find a transform to be
   more normal than the raw data. Thus, we largely employ nonparametric
   analyses. However, to confirm some results, we additionally performed
   some parametric tests under the presumption that parametric tests are
   robust to some degree of deviation from normality (the raw data tends
   to be slightly skewed). All such analyses come with the inevitable
   caveats. Z refers to Wilcoxon signed-rank test and compares pre- and
   post-test scores for the paired data (i.e., individual students who
   took the questionnaire twice). W refers to Mann Whitney U test and
   compares different groups of students (i.e., higher- compared to
   foundation-ability). Internal consistency was evaluated using
   Cronbach’s alpha. Correlations were nonparametric Spearman
   correlations.

   To determine whether a correlation between x and y is significantly
   stronger or weaker than the correlation between z and y, we performed a
   nonparametric Monte Carlo simulation. We start by employing only those
   instances where for any given student, x, y, and z can all be
   calculated (i.e., students who did all pre- and all post-tests). We
   then calculated the 2 Spearman correlations and asked about the
   difference in the Spearman rank coefficient. We then randomised the
   vector y, and considered for each randomised version the correlation
   between x and randomised y and z and randomized y. We again considered
   the modular difference in Spearman rho value for the correlation of
   these 2 individually against variable y (the mean difference in the
   simulants is zero). Repeating the simulation 10,000 times, we asked how
   often the modular difference was as great or greater than that observed
   in the real data. As we employed modular data, the test is 2-tailed.
   The type 1 error rate is then given by p = (n + 1)/(m + 1), where n is
   the number of randomizations in which the randomised dispersion is as
   extreme or more extreme than that observed in the real data and m the
   number of simulations.

   Significance is taken at alpha <lt;0.05. The 3 variables (change in
   evolution acceptance, change in genetics understanding, and change in
   evolution understanding) we consider to be 3 discrete hypotheses and
   thus perform no multitest correction to allow for this dimension of
   multiplicity. However, when stratified by ability, it is reasonable to
   apply a correction to the 2 partitions, thus if p <lt; 0.05/2 is not
   achieved from the raw statistic, we note that the result is not robust
   to multitest correction.

   We declare that statistical analysis was performed on the data at the
   end of the trial and the trial was not extended to try and “find a
   result.”

   Item nonresponse levels were low. We considered alternative means to
   handle nonresponse, but as the numbers are so low, they make no
   difference to results (S1 Text). All raw data can be found in S1 and S2
   Data. S1 Data present the information at a class level. S2 Data
   presents the score data against the individual (anonymised) student.
   Note that the class id is the first digits of the student id.

evolution

   evolution is among the most substantiated concepts in science and is
   the unifying theory of biological science. Charles Darwin
   co-originated, with Alfred Russel Wallace, the theory of evolution by
   natural selection. His masterwork, the 1859 "Origin of Species,"
   offered ample evidence for evolution having occurred, as well as the
   first strong explanation for its mechanism, natural selection. Modern
   evolutionary theory incorporates these concepts: species change over
   time; genetic mutations are responsible for the changes; individuals
   with beneficial genetic mutations will survive preferentially compared
   with their competitors, in a process known as natural selection; those
   successful individuals' more numerous offspring will spread the
   beneficial genetic constructs throughout the population; when enough
   genetic changes reproductively isolate a population, that population
   has become a new species. Here you'll find news and information on
   evolution and the battle with proponents of so-called creation science.

1. What can tree frogs in Chernobyl tell us about radiation?

   Abstract: Have you ever heard of Chernobyl? It was a nuclear power
   plant that released large amounts of radiation into the environment
   after an accident. While the people nearby left the area, the wildlife
   remained. Many plants and animals died because of the high levels of
   radiation. But others, such as tree frogs, adapted. We collected tree
   frogs from different areas surrounding the Chernobyl power plant. We
   analyzed their skin coloration. We found that the frogs closer to the
   power plant had darker skin coloration. That’s because they have higher
   levels of melanin. Melanin is known to protect organisms from
   radiation. We think that darker colored frogs better survived the
   higher levels of radiation closer to the power plant.

   This article is suitable for middle school and lower high school
   students, and is available in Spanish translation. It includes a Lesson
   Idea video and an Audio Edition narrating the adapted article.
     * Key terms: radioactivity, natural selection
     * Scientific figures: bar graph
     * Scientific methods: experiment, field study, observation,
       representative sampling

2. evolution in action: are voles shrinking?

   Abstract: It is not easy being small. Especially when nature seems to
   favor larger individuals. But why don’t all animals evolve to be
   bigger? We studied a wild population of snow voles (a small rodent
   species) in their alpine habitat. Genetic analysis indicated a hidden
   evolutionary change: voles evolved to become smaller but the average
   body size of the population stayed the same. To understand the
   underlying causes, we separated genetic and environmental influences on
   vole body size. We found that young voles with genes for small bodies
   developed faster. This allowed them to survive better when
   environmental conditions changed (earlier arrival of winter). As a
   result, the population evolved towards a smaller body size. Our study
   shows that populations can evolve rapidly. But without a genetic
   perspective and understanding the underlying causes, we may not be able
   to detect these changes.

   This article is suitable for high school students.
     * Key terms: climate change, natural selection
     * Scientific figures: bar graph, line graph
     * Scientific methods: experiment, scientific modeling

3. How will dragonflies adapt to a warmer Earth?

   Abstract: The Earth is getting warmer, and we can see the effects of it
   – destructive floods, severe droughts, and intense storms. Just as we
   must look for ways to adjust to our changing environment, animals and
   plants must also adapt if they want to survive. We wanted to know how
   animals’ reproductive traits change to help them survive in warmer
   climates. We looked at dragonflies because the males use dark coloring
   on their wings to attract mates and intimidate rivals. We created a
   database to compare dragonflies living in warm climates to those living
   in cooler climates. We found that male dragonflies living in warmer
   climates have less wing coloring than those living in cooler climates.
   We also found wing ornamentation in warmer areas to be lighter in
   color. This is because the darker coloring can overheat the dragonfly
   and they become unable to reproduce. Lighter or reduced ornamentation
   is naturally selected when climates are warmer.

   This article is available in both UPPER and LOWER reading levels, and
   is suitable for middle school and high school students. It includes an
   extensive Lesson Plan.
     * Key terms: adaptation, climate change
     * Scientific figures: line graph
     * Scientific methods: climate scenarios, observation

4. What can fossils tell us about the nervous system’s evolution?

   Abstract: What can we learn from fossils? We can estimate the shape and
   size of an extinct animal. Anything else? Well, if soft tissues (like
   the brain or muscles) fossilize, it could tell us how the animal
   functioned or behaved. Unfortunately, soft tissue decomposes quickly
   after an animal dies. They aren’t preserved as fossils very often.
   That’s why we felt really lucky when we came across a fossil of an
   extinct horseshoe crab with a preserved central nervous system (CNS).
   We discovered that the organization of the CNS in our fossil is the
   same as in horseshoe crabs living today. It hasn’t changed in over 300
   million years! We also figured out how our unique fossil might have
   formed. This could help others discover similar fossils in the future.

   This article is suitable for middle school and lower high school
   students. It includes a Lesson Idea video, and an Ask-A-Scientist
   interview with the original researcher.
     * Key terms: fossils, neuroscience, paleontology
     * Scientific figures: pictograph
     * Scientific methods: microscopy, observation

5. Where did flying reptiles come from?

   Abstract: Have you heard of flying dinosaurs named pterodactyls
   [terr-oh-dak-tlz]? Well, you may be surprised to hear that they are not
   technically dinosaurs. Pterodactyls, part of the group pterosaurs
   [terr-oh-sorz], were reptiles. They were related to dinosaurs, which
   are also reptiles, but do not belong to that group. Pterosaurs were the
   first vertebrates that were able to fly by flapping their wings. This
   makes them all the more interesting. Have you ever thought about how it
   is possible that some animals started to fly? How did they get their
   wings? The general answer is: evolution. But here the mystery deepens.
   For a long time it seemed like there was a huge evolutionary gap
   between pterosaurs and most other animals. How did they come about? By
   looking at fossils, we found out that lagerpetids [la-jer-pe-tids] (a
   small group of non-flying reptiles) are close relatives of pterosaurs.
   Finding out about lagerpetids told us a bit about how pterosaurs
   started to fly.

   This article is suitable for middle school and lower high school
   students. It includes an extensive Lesson Plan with slides about
   evolution.
     * Key terms: fossils, dinosaurs, reptiles, paleontology
     * Scientific figures: pictograph
     * Scientific methods: experiment, tomography scans, X-ray scanner

6. Why can some monkeys live high in the mountains?

   Abstract: Geladas are an unusual primate. They eat mostly grass instead
   of fruit or meat. They are known as “bleeding heart monkeys” for the
   bright red patch of skin on their chests. They also live high in the
   mountains instead of in the jungle or the savanna. The air is thinner
   high in the mountains, so it is harder to get enough oxygen. How can
   geladas thrive in that environment? That’s what we wanted to find
   out. We studied the DNA of wild geladas. We found a surprising
   difference in how DNA is packaged between geladas from two different
   regions of Ethiopia. Also, we know that some animals react to low
   oxygen by increasing the amount of hemoglobin in their blood. But we
   learned that geladas don’t do that. Instead, they might have evolved to
   have larger lungs to help them get more oxygen with each breath.

   This article is suitable for high school students. It includes a Lesson
   Idea video.
     * Key terms: genetics, species distribution
     * Scientific figures: map, scatter plot
     * Scientific methods: DNA sequencing, experiment

7. Why do some clownfish not breed?

   Abstract: Clownfish are one of the most well-known tropical fish. But
   even though we see them on our TV screens, what do you know about them
   in real life? They live in social groups in which individuals are
   ranked by size (size-based dominance hierarchy). The two biggest
   dominant individuals breed (have babies), but the smaller individuals
   do not. So why do some clownfish forgo their own reproduction? We
   decided to investigate the smaller clownfish. We looked at the risks
   and rewards of moving to a different home to breed or of contesting to
   breed in their current home. We found that it’s too risky for these
   clownfish to move to a new home. Furthermore, they aren’t likely to
   contest by getting bigger and potentially fight the dominants since
   they risk being evicted from the group. So, they choose to stay put and
   wait in the hope that they will one day be able to breed.

   This article is suitable for middle school students. It includes an
   Ask-A-Scientist interview with the original researcher.
     * Key terms: animal behavior, genetics
     * Scientific figures: pictograph
     * Scientific methods: experiment, field study, observation

8. Why do sharks sleep?

   Abstract: We all know what it feels like when we have not had enough
   sleep. You might feel tired, have trouble concentrating, or even be
   grumpy and irritable. Despite it being such an important part of our
   daily lives, sleep still remains a bit of a mystery! To help answer the
   question of why we sleep, scientists have started researching sleep in
   other animals. This can help us understand how and why sleep evolved.
   Sharks are hundreds of millions of years old. In fact, they are the
   oldest living group of jawed vertebrates! Because of this, we think
   they could help unlock important information about the evolution of
   sleep. We studied the metabolic rate and behavior of draughtsboard
   sharks (Cephaloscyllium isabellum) over a 24-hour period. Our results
   show that when sharks sleep, they typically have a flat body posture
   and a reduced metabolic rate. Our study supports the hypothesis that
   the conservation of energy is a core function of sleep. It also
   provides insight into its evolution.

   This article is available in both UPPER and LOWER reading levels, and
   is suitable for elementary school, middle school and lower high school
   students. It includes a Lesson Idea video.
     * Key terms: animal behavior, metabolism
     * Scientific figures: bar graph, pictograph
     * Scientific methods: experiment, observation

    Zoosystematics and evolution is an international, peer-reviewed life
   science journal devoted to the diversity, systematics and evolution of
   all animal groups, except for insects. It publishes original research
   and review articles at all taxonomic levels. Its scope encompasses
   primary information from collection-related research, taxonomic
   descriptions and discoveries, revisions, annotated type catalogues,
   relevant aspects of the history of science, and contributions on new
   methods and principles of taxonomy and systematics. Articles whose main
   topic is ecology, functional anatomy, physiology, or ethology are only
   acceptable when of clear systematic or evolutionary relevance and
   perspective. Studies on insects should be submitted to the sister
   journal of ZSE, Deutsche Entomologische Zeitschrift (DEZ).

Large moons are still significant for evolution

   Published 16 January 2019

   From Guy Cox, St Albans, New South Wales, Australia

   Eric Kvaalen notes the sun's contribution to tides on Earth (Letters,
   15 December 2018), in response to my letter on the importance of lunar
   tides to life moving from the oceans to land (3 November 2018). With
   respect, I didn't suggest that there would be no tides on Earth without
   our large moon. But the moon is the major determinant of our tides.

   Large tides may have allowed life to move onto land despite the
   advantages of the ocean: narrower temperature range, no risk of
   dehydration, little need for strong skeletons, and so on. If we ever do
   find intelligent life elsewhere, I still predict it will be aquatic.

   Use joints, bones and muscles to build creatures that are only limited
   by your imagination. Watch how the combination of a neural network and
   a genetic algorithm can enable your creatures to "learn" and improve at
   their given tasks all on their own.

   The tasks include running, jumping, climbing and flying. Can you build
   the ultimate creature that is good at all of the tasks?

evolution might stop humans from solving climate change, researchers say

   by Marcus Wolf, University of Maine
   evolution might stop humans from solving climate change, says new study
   Dimensions of environmental management create an attractor landscape
   for long-term human evolution. Environmental sustainability challenges
   (curved frontiers) require a minimum level of cooperation in a society
   of a certain minimum spatial size. Alternative potential paths move
   humanity toward different long-term evolutionary outcomes. In path B,
   competition between societies over common environmental resources
   creates cultural selection between groups for increasingly direct
   competition and conflict. Path A, growing cooperation between societies
   facilitates the emergence of global cultural traits to preserve shared
   environmental benefits. Credit: Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
   Society B: Biological Sciences (2023). DOI: 10.1098/rstb.2022.0259

   Central features of human evolution may stop our species from resolving
   global environmental problems like climate change, says a recent study
   led by the University of Maine.

   Humans have come to dominate the planet with tools and systems to
   exploit natural resources that were refined over thousands of years
   through the process of cultural adaptation to the environment.
   University of Maine evolutionary biologist Tim Waring wanted to know
   how this process of cultural adaptation to the environment might
   influence the goal of solving global environmental problems. What he
   found was counterintuitive.

   The project sought to understand three core questions: how human
   evolution has operated in the context of environmental resources, how
   human evolution has contributed to the multiple global environmental
   crises, and how global environmental limits might change the outcomes
   of human evolution in the future.

   Waring's team outlined their findings in a new paper published in
   Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. Other authors of the
   study include Zach Wood, UMaine alumni, and Eörs Szathmáry, a professor
   at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary.

Human expansion

   The study explored how human societies' use of the environment changed
   over our evolutionary history. The research team investigated changes
   in the ecological niche of human populations, including factors such as
   the natural resources they used, how intensively they were used, what
   systems and methods emerged to use those resources and the
   environmental impacts that resulted from their usage.
   [INS: :INS]

   This effort revealed a set of common patterns. Over the last 100,000
   years, human groups have progressively used more types of resources,
   with more intensity, at greater scales and with greater environmental
   impacts. Those groups often then spread to new environments with new
   resources.

   The global human expansion was facilitated by the process of cultural
   adaptation to the environment. This leads to the accumulation of
   adaptive cultural traits—social systems and technology to help exploit
   and control environmental resources such as agricultural practices,
   fishing methods, irrigation infrastructure, energy technology and
   social systems for managing each of these.

   "Human evolution is mostly driven by cultural change, which is faster
   than genetic evolution. That greater speed of adaptation has made it
   possible for humans to colonize all habitable land worldwide," says
   Waring, associate professor with the UMaine Senator George J. Mitchell
   Center for Sustainability Solutions and the School of Economics.

   Moreover, this process accelerates because of a positive feedback
   process: as groups get larger, they accumulate adaptive cultural traits
   more rapidly, which provides more resources and enables faster growth.

   "For the last 100,000 years, this has been good news for our species as
   a whole." Waring says, "but this expansion has depended on large
   amounts of available resources and space."

   Today, humans have also run out of space. We have reached the physical
   limits of the biosphere and laid claim to most of the resources it has
   to offer. Our expansion also is catching up with us. Our cultural
   adaptations, particularly the industrial use of fossil fuels, have
   created dangerous global environmental problems that jeopardize our
   safety and access to future resources.

Global limits

   To see what these findings mean for solving global challenges like
   climate change, the research team looked at when and how sustainable
   human systems emerged in the past. Waring and his colleagues found two
   general patterns. First, sustainable systems tend to grow and spread
   only after groups have struggled or failed to maintain their resources
   in the first place.

   For example, the U.S. regulated industrial sulfur and nitrogen dioxide
   emissions in 1990, but only after we had determined that they caused
   acid rain and acidified many water bodies in the Northeast. This
   delayed action presents a major problem today as we threaten other
   global limits. For climate change, humans need to solve the problem
   before we cause a crash.

   Second, researchers also found evidence that strong systems of
   environmental protection tend to address problems within existing
   societies, not between them. For example, managing regional water
   systems requires regional cooperation, regional infrastructure and
   technology, and these arise through regional cultural evolution. The
   presence of societies of the right scale is therefore a critical
   limiting factor.

   Tackling the climate crisis effectively will probably require new
   worldwide regulatory, economic and social systems—ones that generate
   greater cooperation and authority than existing systems like the Paris
   Agreement. To establish and operate those systems, humans need a
   functional social system for the planet, which we don't have.

   "One problem is that we don't have a coordinated global society which
   could implement these systems," says Waring, "We only have sub-global
   groups, which probably won't suffice. But you can imagine cooperative
   treaties to address these shared challenges. So, that's the easy
   problem."

   The other problem is much worse, Waring says. In a world filled with
   sub-global groups, cultural evolution among these groups will tend to
   solve the wrong problems, benefiting the interests of nations and
   corporations and delaying action on shared priorities. Cultural
   evolution among groups would tend to exacerbate resource competition
   and could lead to direct conflict between groups and even global human
   dieback.

   "This means global challenges like climate change are much harder to
   solve than previously considered," says Waring. "It's not just that
   they are the hardest thing our species has ever done. They absolutely
   are. The bigger problem is that central features in human evolution are
   likely working against our ability to solve them. To solve global
   collective challenges we have to swim upstream."
   [INS: :INS]

Looking forward

   Waring and his colleagues think that their analysis can help navigate
   the future of human evolution on a limited Earth. Their paper is the
   first to propose that human evolution may oppose the emergence of
   collective global problems and further research is needed to develop
   and test this theory.

   Waring's team proposes several applied research efforts to better
   understand the drivers of cultural evolution and search for ways to
   reduce global environmental competition, given how human evolution
   works. For example, research is needed to document the patterns and
   strength of human cultural evolution in the past and present. Studies
   could focus on the past processes that lead to the human domination of
   the biosphere, and on the ways cultural adaptation to the environment
   is occurring today.

   But if the general outline proves to be correct, and human evolution
   tends to oppose collective solutions to global environmental problems,
   as the authors suggest, then some very pressing questions need to be
   answered. This includes whether we can use this knowledge to improve
   the global response to climate change.

   "There is hope, of course, that humans may solve climate change. We
   have built cooperative governance before, although never like this: in
   a rush at a global scale," Waring says.

   The growth of international environmental policy provides some hope.
   Successful examples include the Montreal Protocol to limit
   ozone-depleting gases and the global moratorium on commercial whaling.

   New efforts should include fostering more intentional, peaceful and
   ethical systems of mutual self-limitation, particularly through market
   regulations and enforceable treaties, that bind human groups across the
   planet together ever more tightly into a functional unit.

   But that model may not work for climate change.

   "Our paper explains why and how building cooperative governance at the
   global scale is different, and helps researchers and policymakers be
   more clear-headed about how to work toward global solutions," says
   Waring.

   This new research could lead to a novel policy mechanism to address the
   climate crisis: Modifying the process of adaptive change among
   corporations and nations may be a powerful way to address global
   environmental risks.

   As for whether humans can continue to survive on a limited planet,
   Waring says, "We don't have any solutions for this idea of a long-term
   evolutionary trap, as we barely understand the problem. If our
   conclusions are even close to being correct, we need to study this much
   more carefully."

   feet, the tallest plants on the planet—thrive mostly in a narrow strip
   of land in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Most of them
   grow from southern Oregon down into Northern California, snugged up
   against the rugged Pacific coast.

   They have grown by slowly responding to moisture and rich alluvial soil
   over millenniums, combined with a genetic payload that pushes them to
   the upper limits of tree height. They are at risk—down to perhaps
   70,000 individuals, falling from at least a half-million trees before
   humans arrived, but that's not a new story, for we are all at risk.

   Redwoods, like all trees, are engineered marvels. People don't tend to
   think of natural things as "structures," leaving that term to stand in
   for buildings, bridges, and dams. But although trees were not built by
   humans, they didn't just happen.

   They have come into their own through the inexorably turning wheels of
   natural selection and evolution, responding to environmental pressures,
   genetic drift, and mutation (they even have two kinds of leaves that
   help the trees adapt to both wet and dry conditions). They are born to
   change, just as humans are born to change.

   evolution is usually a very slow process, although sometimes it's
   surprisingly quick. New, intense pressures of a warming and changing
   climate are speeding things up and forcing researchers and
   horticulturists to examine approaches to climate change resilience and
   technologies like geographic information systems.

   Of course, there are differences between man-made edifices and trees. A
   structure or building typically is a sort of island unto itself,
   separate from its neighbors; in contrast, the coast redwood is an
   ecosystem with enormously broad consequences for other life forms.
   [INS: :INS]

   Life is folded in and among the redwoods, below and within and about
   them. The trees are integrators, bringing together many life forms.
   Some of these life forms rely on the tree, others on occupants in and
   around the tree.

   The coast redwood hosts so many different ecological interactions that
   it's faintly ridiculous. Consider the wandering salamander, which
   usually spends its entire life high in the canopy, but sometimes must
   jump out to escape predators. Without wings or gliding, it falls from a
   great height only to land perfectly unharmed on the ground.

   It took scientists dropping these creatures into a wind tunnel and
   filming them with high-speed cameras to understand why they didn't end
   up as a wet splat on the forest floor. As it turns out, the
   salamander's flattened body shape and large feet with long toes create
   just enough drag and balance for a soft landing.

   Redwoods are so large that one reportedly was found to house a Sitka
   spruce, 8 feet tall, growing far off the ground within the larger tree.
   Redwoods also have served for millenniums as nesting habitat for huge
   California condors, with wingspans of nearly 10 feet.

   There's also a place for the tiny, living side by side with all of the
   largeness tucked in the complex, secret interstices of these trees.
   Nestled into extensive mats of ferns that grow high up in redwood
   canopies, researchers find aquatic crustaceans called copepods that
   normally would live in larger bodies of water. No one knows how they
   got into the trees, but the fern mats trap enormous quantities of
   moisture from rain and fog, creating wetlands in the sky.

   Yet even species as enduring as coast redwoods are affected by climate
   change. Diminished moisture stresses the trees, making them grow with
   less vigor. New fire dangers put them at risk, and more frequent floods
   erode the big trees' footing. But redwoods also are adapting.

   A 2018 survey of nine large redwood trees found a total of 137 species
   of lichen growing on the trees, including several that were new to
   science. One was Xylopsora canopeorum, whose specific name celebrates
   the canopy where it was discovered.

   This lichen seems to be unique to the warmer and drier forests in
   California's Sonoma and Santa Cruz counties, in the southern part of
   the coast redwoods' range. This is an exciting finding, for it provides
   evidence that new forms of life—ecosystem partners—may be evolving in
   sync with trees that are also evolving in the face of climate change.

   A pair of redwoods grow just outside my office at the Huntington in San
   Marino, which is some 700 miles south of the coast redwood's usual
   range. I've resisted giving names to this duo, although many giant
   redwoods have monikers like Adventure, Brutus, Nugget, Paradox, and
   Atlas—most named by the scientists who first quantified their extreme
   heights.

   The redwoods outside my window are perhaps 100 feet tall—puny by
   comparison to their northern brethren. But they are healthy and will
   continue to be shaped by their immediate environments. They've traveled
   far to get here, planted more than a half-century ago by an earlier
   generation of horticulturalists, and they're thriving in their new
   home. We should all be so lucky.

Unraveling the evolutionary origins of umami and sweet taste preferences

   by Kindai University
   Unraveling the evolutionary origins of umami and sweet taste
   preferences A new study led by researchers from Kindai University
   identified five new groups of umami and sweet taste receptors within
   the TAS1R family (TAS1R 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) and also diversity in TAS1R2
   and TAS1R3 genes. Credit: Hidenori Nishihara from Kindai University

   The perception of taste is one of the most important senses and helps
   us identify beneficial foods and avoid harmful substances. For
   instance, our fondness for sweet and savory foods results from our need
   to consume carbohydrates and proteins. Given their importance as an
   evolutionary trait, researchers around the world are investigating how
   taste receptors originated and evolved over a period of time. Obtaining
   these insights into the feeding behavior of organisms can help them
   paint a picture of the history of life on Earth.

   One of the important tastes in our taste palette is umami, or the
   savory taste, which is associated with proteins that form a vital part
   of the diets of many organisms. The taste receptor type 1 (T1R) detects
   sweet and umami tastes among mammals. This taste receptor is encoded by
   the TAS1R, a family of genes, including TAS1R1, TAS1R2, and TAS1R3, and
   comes from a common ancestor of bony vertebrates.

   However, this gene pattern is not observed in coelacanth and
   cartilaginous fishes, where "taxonomically unplaced" TAS1R genes have
   been identified, suggesting an incomplete understanding of the
   evolutionary history of taste receptors.

   Now, however, a research team led by Associate Professor Hidenori
   Nishihara from Kindai University and Professor Yoshiro Ishimaru from
   Meiji University, Japan, have identified five new, previously
   undiscovered groups within the TAS1R family. This discovery is a result
   of a genome-wide survey of jawed vertebrates including all major fish
   groups.

   The study, published in Nature Ecology &amp; evolution on December 13,
   2023, includes the contributions of Senior Assistant Professor Yasuka
   Toda from Meiji University, Professor Masataka Okabe from The Jikei
   University School of Medicine, Professor Shigehiro Kuraku from the
   National Institute of Genetics, and Project Associate Professor Shinji
   Okada from The University of Tokyo.
   [INS: :INS]

   "Our study revealed that as compared to most modern vertebrates, the
   vertebrate ancestor possessed more T1Rs. These findings challenge the
   paradigm that only three T1R family members have been retained during
   evolution," says Prof. Nishihara.
   Unraveling the evolutionary origins of umami and sweet taste
   preferences The color key indicates the names of the various T1R
   members. Filled, colored circles on the branches indicate the presence
   of the TAS1R members, whereas open circles indicate their absence.
   Arrowheads above open circles indicate that the TAS1R member was lost
   at the branch. Credit: Hidenori Nishihara from Kindai University

   The novel taste receptor genes, named TAS1R4, TAS1R5, TAS1R6, TAS1R7,
   and TAS1R8 by the researchers, were categorized based on their
   distribution among species with a common ancestor. The researchers
   found TAS1R4 genes to be present in lizards, axolotl, lungfishes,
   coelacanth, bichir, and cartilaginous fishes, but absent in mammals,
   birds, crocodilians, turtles, and teleost fishes. In addition, axolotl,
   lungfishes, and coelacanth were found to have TAS1R5.

   The researchers observed a close evolutionary relationship between
   TAS1R5, TAS1R1, and TAS1R2, indicating a shared ancestry between these
   genes. The cartilaginous fishes possess TAS1R6 exclusively. Notably,
   the researchers found that TAS1R6 evolved from the same ancestral gene
   that led to TAS1R1, TAS1R2, and TAS1R5 genes. While axolotl and lizards
   possess TAS1R7, bichir and lungfishes possess TAS1R8. The researchers
   determined that these two genes originated in the common ancestor of
   jawed vertebrates.

   In addition to these new genes, the study revealed diversity in the
   existing TAS1R genes. For instance, they found that TAS1R3 of bony
   vertebrates could be divided into TAS1R3A and TAS1R3B. TAS1R3A was
   present in tetrapods and lungfishes, while TAS1R3B was identified in
   amphibians, lungfishes, coelacanths, and ray-finned fishes.
   Additionally, the genome survey found TAS1R2 to have diversified into
   two distinct groups (TAS1R2A and TAS1R2B), challenging the conventional
   idea that TAS1R2 forms a single gene group.

   "We found that the TAS1R phylogenetic tree comprises of a total of 11
   TAS1R clades, revealing an unexpected gene diversity," adds Prof.
   Nishihara.

   The findings also suggest that the first TAS1R gene appeared in jawed
   vertebrates around 615–473 million years ago. The gene then underwent
   several duplications to produce nine taste receptor genes (TAS1R1,2A,
   2B, 3A, 3B, 4, 5, 7, and 8) in the common ancestor of bony vertebrates.
   Over time, some of these genes were lost in different lineages, with
   mammals and teleosts retaining only three TAS1Rs (TAS1R1, TAS1R2A, and
   TAS1R3A in mammals).

   In addition to shedding light on the evolutionary history, the findings
   also have practical applications. Explaining these to us, Prof.
   Nishihara says, "These findings make it easier for us to deduce the
   taste preferences of diverse vertebrates. This, in turn, can have
   potential applications such as the development of pet foods and
   attractants tailored to the preferences of fish, amphibians, and
   reptiles."

   of T1R receptors reveals diversity in taste perception, Nature Ecology

   David Baker’s Sex: Two Billion Years of Procreation and Recreation
   condenses the story of the evolution of (predominantly) reproductive
   sex into 300 pages. That is quite a feat.

   The book is one of the latest additions to the popular “Big History”
   genre. First defined by Macquarie University historian David Christian
   in the early 1990s, the idea of Big History is that the temporal scale
   on which history should be studied is “the whole of time”. Its ambition
   is no less than to survey history from the Big Bang to the present,
   taking an interdisciplinary approach to its scholarship.

   Baker is a science writer with a PhD in Big History and one of the
   writers behind the Big History Crash Course on YouTube. In his
   introduction to Sex, he declares “this is the first book that seeks to
   weave together the grand narrative of sex in its entirety”.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Sex: Two Billion Years of Procreation and Recreation – David Christian
   (Black Inc.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   The book is divided into three sections. The first – titled
   evolutionary Foreplay – covers the period from 13.8 billion to 66
   million years ago. Baker races through the 10 billion years following
   the Big Bang, when “the cosmos was devoid of life”.

   He summarises the formation of Earth and its atmosphere, the origins of
   living organisms 3.8 billion years ago, the emergence of DNA, and the
   cloning (asexual reproduction) of “microscopic blobs living on the edge
   of underwater volcanoes”.

   We are taken from the earliest forms of sexual reproduction between two
   single-celled organisms to the differentiation of cells, and on to the
   evolution of specialised reproductive cells, the gametes. This
   development was followed by the rapid appearance of diverse animal
   species, from fish and amphibians to reptiles, insects, dinosaurs,
   birds and mammals.

   In the second section, Primate Climax – which covers the period from 66
   million to 315,000 years ago – we learn about the development of
   external genitals and the birth of “the age of the orgasm”, as well as
   primate sexual behaviour and social organisation.

   The final section, Cultural Afterglow, which extends from 315,000 years
   ago to the present, traces the history of Homo sapiens from
   hunter-gatherers, to the first agrarian societies, and on to the
   present day.

   The word length of each section is inversely proportional to the time
   scale being described – a reflection of our relative knowledge about
   sexual behaviour, but also its evolving complexity over time.

evolution

   Baker’s prose is animated and deliberately raunchy, making what would
   be a dense read light and entertaining. But to weave his “grand
   narrative of sex” he also anthropomorphises reproduction of even the
   earliest living organisms.

   For example, explaining theory behind the first, possibly accidental,
   mixing of genes two billion years ago, Baker describes “Snowball Earth”
   – a period when the average global temperature was minus 50 degrees
   Celsius. His argument is that asexual reproduction at this time of
   catastrophic climatic conditions was causing overpopulation and that
   sexual reproduction would slow population growth.

   This sounds counter-intuitive, but sexual reproduction takes time, much
   longer than simply cloning oneself. Two separate, unrelated organisms
   need to find each other and then exchange DNA. And it seems that the
   very first time this happened was what Baker describes as “cannibal
   sex”: one cell ingesting another due to starvation and accidentally
   mixing DNA. Baker thus writes:

     To put it slightly more crudely, 2 billion years ago our ancestors
     felt so much pressure from the environment that they needed to fuck
     in order to survive.

   A few pages later, he writes “furthermore, sex bequeathed upon those
   hardy, horny eukaryotes the potential for rapid evolution into
   increasingly complex species”.

   Throughout his descriptions of sexual and reproductive behaviour of
   pre-primate species, Baker attributes very human characteristics to
   living organisms that simply don’t make sense. While this can be
   amusing, I also found it slightly irritating. The long bow being drawn
   between “sexual” behaviour involving the first exchange of DNA by
   single-celled organisms and the first modern humans is long indeed.

   Eukaryotes. Rattiya Thongdumhyu/Shutterstock

   Baker provides an interesting summary of the diversity among our
   primate ancestors. He notes differences in anatomy and genital size,
   and considers variations in practices such as masturbation and sexual
   partnering, including polygamy, monogamy, promiscuity, homosexual and
   bisexual behaviour.

   He delves into the issues of pleasure, romantic love and parenting, and
   related forms of social organisation, such as patriarchy and
   matriarchy. And he considers variations, such as patrilocality (where
   males remain in their families and females move out to live with the
   male parent of their offspring) and its reverse, matrilocality.

   Baker also points out that a pleasure response to copulation can be
   seen in fish and reptiles, similar to the sensations experienced after
   eating, but that the orgasm emerges with placental mammals.

   It is, however, the evolution of human culture that radically changes
   everything. Baker condenses a few hundred thousand years of the history
   of human sexuality into 150 pages. He covers diversity (including
   intersex characteristics and gender and sexual diversity) and considers
   the ways in which societies have controlled sexuality and sexual
   behaviour through legal and other sanctions.

   Central to these cultural practices is the control of female sexuality,
   which emerged with the development of agriculture and the need to
   retain land ownership and safeguard inheritance down patriarchal lines.

The future of sex

   In the book’s final chapter, The Future of Sex, Baker shares his belief
   that “Nurture has ceased to impede the sexual impulses of Nature”,
   leading to a state where “loneliness is at an all-time high and
   personal happiness is at its lowest ebb”.

   This is a sweeping statement. How did we measure loneliness and
   personal happiness in, say, Ancient Egypt? Do experiences of loneliness
   and personal happiness vary around the globe? Do they mean different
   things in different cultures?

   Informing some of Baker’s thinking are statistics about the number of
   Millennials “projected to never get married in their lifetimes” and the
   decline in rates of casual sex. But it is not clear if they are only
   from studies in Western countries or how representative they are at a
   global level.

   Baker concludes the book with four categories of future forecasts. His
   “projected future” is based on current observation. Here he predicts a
   rise in singledom and a state where promiscuity and sexlessness both
   exist and birth rates decline.

   His “probable future” anticipates a “cultural rejection of
   relationships as the key to happiness”. It would involve more hook-ups
   and the growing replacement of human-to-human sex with sex dolls and
   bots. Alternatively, Baker suggests humanity might swing back towards
   traditional monogamous couplings, or a revival of polygyny, or a
   “promiscuity overdrive”.

   In a “possible future”, he considers how internet technology might lead
   to virtual, AI-driven partnered sex. Finally, in a “preposterous
   future”, he suggests that sex could cease to be important to living
   organisms at all.

   While Baker’s deliberations are interesting and worth pondering, it is
   difficult to accept his claim that “the liberalisation of attitudes
   towards sex has released human sexuality from the grip of culture”.
   Indeed, the statement is something of an oxymoron, since “liberalising
   attitudes” are themselves a cultural phenomenon.

   The “grip of culture” is still ever-present in the policing of female
   sexual behaviour, which continues to the present day the world over. So
   does the epidemic of sexual violence against women.

   The other aspect of Baker’s book that I wonder about is its
   “knowability”. How many of the “facts” presented are really known? How
   much is be conjecture? While there is an impressive list of references
   at the end of the book, Baker admits that many of the beliefs he shares
   about the evolution of sex are not certain.

   This speaks, in part, to the tensions that exist between “Big History”
   and “Deep History”. Big History presents itself as an answer to an
   existential question – why are we here? But, as some critics have
   argued, humans do not “easily fit into a Big History framework”.

   Baker concludes with a statement about what he wanted to achieve in
   writing this book. He hopes that “some aspects of sex have become
   slightly less baffling for the reader” and wishes his readers the
   “sensation of feeling truly loved” – a kind sentiment, but slightly at
   odds with what has come before.

   From my perspective, the world has a long way to go to achieve human
   rights for all in the areas of sexuality and gender. If Baker’s book
   helps this endeavour by getting us to think about human sexuality more
   deeply, then it will prove worthwhile.

   In evolutionary theory, adaptation is the biological mechanism by which
   organisms adjust to new environments or to changes in their current
   environment. Although scientists discussed adaptation prior to the
   1800s, it was not until then that Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel
   Wallace developed the theory of natural selection.

   Wallace believed that the evolution of organisms was connected in some
   way with adaptation of organisms to changing environmental conditions.
   In developing the theory of evolution by natural selection, Wallace and
   Darwin both went beyond simple adaptation by explaining how organisms
   adapt and evolve. The idea of natural selection is that traits that can
   be passed down allow organisms to adapt to the environment better than
   other organisms of the same species. This enables better survival and
   reproduction compared with other members of the species, leading to
   evolution.

   Organisms can adapt to an environment in different ways. They can adapt
   biologically, meaning they alter body functions. An example of
   biological adaptation can be seen in the bodies of people living at
   high altitudes, such as Tibet. Tibetans thrive at altitudes where
   oxygen levels are up to 40 percent lower than at sea level. Breathing
   air that thin would cause most people to get sick, but Tibetans’ bodies
   have evolved changes in their body chemistry. Most people can survive
   at high altitudes for a short time because their bodies raise their
   levels of hemoglobin, a protein that transports oxygen in the blood.
   However, continuously high levels of hemoglobin are dangerous, so
   increased hemoglobin levels are not a good solution to high-altitude
   survival in the long term. Tibetans seemed to have evolved genetic
   mutations that allow them to use oxygen far more efficently without the
   need for extra hemoglobin.

   Organisms can also exhibit behavioral adaptation. One example of
   behavioral adaptation is how emperor penguins in Antarctica crowd
   together to share their warmth in the middle of winter.

   Scientists who studied adaptation prior to the development of
   evolutionary theory included Georges Louis Leclerc Comte de Buffon. He
   was a French mathematician who believed that organisms changed over
   time by adapting to the environments of their geographical locations.
   Another French thinker, Jean Baptiste Lamarck, proposed that animals
   could adapt, pass on their adaptations to their offspring, and
   therefore evolve. The example he gave stated the ancestors of giraffes
   might have adapted to a shortage of food from short trees by stretching
   their necks to reach higher branches. In Lamarck’s thinking, the
   offspring of a giraffe that stretched its neck would then inherit a
   slightly longer neck. Lamarck theorized that behaviors aquired in a
   giraffe's lifetime would affect its offspring. However, it was Darwin’s
   concept of natural selection, wherein favorable traits like a long neck
   in giraffes suvived not because of aquired skills, but because only
   giraffes that had long enough necks to feed themselves survived long
   enough to reproduce. Natural selection, then, provides a more
   compelling mechanism for adaptation and evolution than Lamarck's
   theories.

   Though they've been extinct for millions of years, the prehistoric
   group of crustaceans called trilobites (literally "three lobes") were
   some of the most successful early animals, and were prevalent the ocean
   for hundreds of millions of years.

   evolution is an important field of study for scientists. It covers the
   study of changes organisms have undergone over time in response to
   different factors in their environment. All organisms, including
   humans, evolve over time. evolution occurs through natural selection,
   and is a force that has shaped every organism living today.
   When developing his theory of evolution and the concept of natural
   selection, Charles Darwin studied the species of finches in the
   Galapagos Islands and hypothesized that they all originated from a
   single common ancestor.

Darwin’s Finches

   Have the students read about and research the finches Darwin studied on
   the Galapagos Islands. Darwin noticed that different finches had
   differently shaped beaks. He also noticed that the various beak shapes
   were each best suited for handling certain types of food. Darwin knew
   that the finches had come from continental South America originally,
   but those that he saw on the islands were unlike the ones on the
   mainland. Darwin wondered what caused these finches to change when they
   made it to the Galapagos Islands. Have students test the ability of
   different beaks to get different types of food. Provide students with
   spoons, forks, metal binders clip, and tweezers to represent different
   types of beaks and food bowl with foam packing peanuts, small bird
   seed, large bird seed (sunflower seeds), and toothpicks. Have student
   try the different tools and identify which tool works best with which
   foods.
   As the Earth grows warmer due to climate change, the colorful, lush,
   but delicate ecosystems of coral reefs are being forced to evolve
   quickly to survive the stresses of a warming planet.

National Geographic Explorer Jingchun Li: evolution of “Living Solar Panels”

   The first thing you notice when visiting a healthy marine coral reef is
   the number of different fishes and the many bright colors of both the
   fishes and the corals. Marine biodiversity refers to the richness of
   different species living together in a community. Have the students
   read about National Geographic Explorer Jingchun Li and her research on
   marine biodiversity and biologically productive coral reef ecosystems.
   Li is studying how coral reefs and other organisms are undergoing
   macroevolution to cope with the stresses created by human disturbances
   to their ecosystem.

   Divide students into groups. Ask the students what stresses are taking
   place in the marine environment that coral reefs and other marine
   organisms need to adapt to. Have them divide into small groups and
   research these changes and design solutions to address these
   disturbances.
   Modern humans, Homo sapiens, owe their existence to a collection of
   earlier, now-extinct Homo species, like this Homo
   neanderthalensis, who's skull appears similar, but not quite identical,
   to the skulls of modern humans.

Human evolution

   Scientists who study early humans depend on fossil evidence to help
   them sort out how our ancestors evolved over time. When looking at the
   fossils, scientists look for clues to changes in different
   characteristics such as brain size, skull shape, locomotion, and jaw
   size. Have the students learn about human evolution, then have them
   work through the Mystery Skull Interactive to use clues to identify
   fossils.
   The Count Raggi's bird of paradise (Paradisaea raggiana) is not only a
   stunningly colorful and elegant bird, it is also the national bird of
   Papua New Guinea.

evolution in Isolation

   Have the students watch the video about the birds living on the island
   of Papua in Indonesia. This isolated island is a paradise with a lush
   and resource-rich habitat. Male birds of many different species have
   evolved elaborate ways of attracting mates. Ask the students, why is it
   important for a species to have the strongest males mate with the
   females and how does this affect the species?
   Jeremy Martin excavates crocodile fossils from Cretaceous sediment to
   better understand how crocodiles have evolved over millions of years.

National Geographic Explorer Jeremy Emiland Martin: evolution of Crocodiles

   Have the students read about Jeremy Emiland Martin’s work on the
   evolution of crocodiles and then have them research how modern
   crocodiles have been evolving since the time of the dinosaurs. Because
   crocodiles are found in so many different areas of the world, it is
   important to go back to where they first emerged to learn about their
   evolutionary beginnings. Ask the students, how have crocodiles evolved
   since the Cretaceous Period? What might have caused crocodiles to
   evolve? Why were these traits favorable in this particular environment?

Genetic Variation

Genetic Variation

   Genetic variation is the presence of differences in sequences of genes
   between individual organisms of a species. It enables natural
   selection, one of the primary forces driving the evolution of life.

genetic variation

   In many species, special genetic variations give animals a camouflaged
   appearance to blend in with their environment, like this Catalpa Sphinx

   Genetic variation refers to differences among the genomes of members of
   the same species. A genome is all the hereditary information—all the
   genes—of an organism. For instance, the human genome contains somewhere
   between twenty and twenty-five thousand genes.

   Genes are units of hereditary information, and they carry instructions
   for building proteins. The genes that are encoded within these proteins
   are what enable cells to function. Most organisms that reproduce
   sexually have two copies of each gene, because each parent cell or
   organism donates a single copy of its genes to its offspring.
   Additionally, genes can exist in slightly different forms, called
   alleles, which further adds to genetic variation.

   The combination of alleles of a gene that an individual receives from
   both parents determines what biologists call the genotype for a
   particular trait, such as hair texture. The genotype that an individual
   possesses for a trait, in turn, determines the phenotype—the observable
   characteristics—such as whether that individual actually ends up with
   straight, wavy, or curly hair.

   Genetic variation within a species can result from a few different
   sources. Mutations, the changes in the sequences of genes in DNA, are
   one source of genetic variation. Another source is gene flow, or the
   movement of genes between different groups of organisms. Finally,
   genetic variation can be a result of sexual reproduction, which leads
   to the creation of new combinations of genes.

   Genetic variation in a group of organisms enables some organisms to
   survive better than others in the environment in which they live.
   Organisms of even a small population can differ strikingly in terms of
   how well suited they are for life in a certain environment. An example
   would be moths of the same species with different color wings. Moths
   with wings similar to the color of tree bark are better able to
   camouflage themselves than moths of a different color. As a result, the
   tree-colored moths are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on
   their genes. This process is called natural selection, and it is the
   main force that drives evolution.

Artificial Selection

Artificial Selection

   Artificial selection is the identification by humans of desirable
   traits in plants and animals, and the steps taken to enhance and
   perpetuate those traits in future generations. Artificial selection
   works the same way as natural selection, except that with natural
   selection it is nature, not human interference, that makes these
   decisions.

pigeons

   Like many animals kept in human captivity, mating pairs of pigeons are
   often paired together based on their genetics to achieve the most
   desirable traits in their offspring.

   Like many animals kept in human captivity, mating pairs of pigeons are
   often paired together based on their genetics to achieve the most

   In laying out the evidence for his theory of evolution by natural
   selection in his 1859 book, On the Origin of Species, the British
   naturalist and biologist Charles Darwin highlighted the physical traits
   and behaviors of several species of bird called finches. During a
   voyage in the 1830s, Darwin had observed these birds on the Galápagos
   Islands, a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean west of South America.

   Sometimes summed up by the phrase “survival of the fittest,” natural
   selection is based on the following principles: In nature, organisms
   produce more offspring than are able to survive and reproduce.
   Offspring with traits that make them more likely to survive, mature,
   and reproduce in the environment they inhabit pass on their traits to
   the next generation.

   As this happens generation after generation, natural selection acts as
   a kind of sieve, or a remover of undesirable traits. Organisms
   therefore gradually become better-suited for their environment. If the
   environment changes, natural selection will then push organisms to
   evolve in a different direction to adapt to their new circumstances.

   How does this relate to finches? On the Galápagos Islands, some finches
   appeared so different from others that Darwin did not realize at first
   that they were all finches. In fact, they were different species of
   finches with a variety of traits. Some finches, for instance, had long,
   narrow beaks, while others had short, thick beaks. Darwin concluded
   that the traits of the different populations of finches had changed
   over time, and that these variations were related to different
   environments in the islands. Each type of beak had evolved for a
   specific task. Where there was a large supply of seeds on the ground,
   for instance, short-beaked finches became more common, because these
   beaks were better at cracking open the seeds. Where cactus plants were
   more common, finches developed long, narrow beaks to extract pollen and
   nectar from cactus flowers.

   Darwin’s finches constituted powerful evidence for natural selection.
   But Darwin was also inspired greatly by the evolution that he saw in
   the traits of pigeons, not due to natural selection but rather
   artificial selection. Breeding pigeons was a popular hobby in England
   in Darwin’s time. By selecting which pigeons were allowed to mate,
   people had a profound effect on their appearance, such as the shape and
   size of their beaks and the color of their feathers.

   Dog breeding is another prime example of artificial selection. Although
   all dogs are descendants of the wolf, the use of artificial selection
   has allowed humans to drastically alter the appearance of dogs. For
   centuries, dogs have been bred for various desired characteristics,
   leading to the creation of a wide range of dogs, from the tiny
   Chihuahua to the massive Great Dane.

   Artificial selection has long been used in agriculture to produce
   animals and crops with desirable traits. The meats sold today are the
   result of the selective breeding of chickens, cattle, sheep, and pigs.
   Many fruits and vegetables have been improved or even created through
   artificial selection. For example, broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage
   were all derived from the wild mustard plant through selective
   breeding. Artificial selection appeals to humans since it is faster
   than natural selection and allows humans to mold organisms to their
   needs.

   Ideas aimed at explaining how organisms change, or evolve, over time
   date back to Anaximander of Miletus, a Greek philosopher who lived in
   the 500s B.C.E. Noting that human babies are born helpless, Anaximander
   speculated that humans must have descended from some other type of
   creature whose young could survive without any help. He concluded that
   those ancestors must be fish, since fish hatch from eggs and
   immediately begin living with no help from their parents. From this
   reasoning, he proposed that all life began in the sea.

   Anaximander was correct; humans can indeed trace our ancestry back to
   fish. His idea, however, was not a theory in the scientific meaning of
   the word, because it could not be subjected to testing that might
   support it or prove it wrong. In science, the word “theory” indicates a
   very high level of certainty. Scientists talk about evolution as a
   theory, for instance, just as they talk about Einstein’s explanation of
   gravity as a theory.

   A theory is an idea about how something in nature works that has gone
   through rigorous testing through observations and experiments designed
   to prove the idea right or wrong. When it comes to the evolution of
   life, various philosophers and scientists, including an
   eighteenth-century English doctor named Erasmus Darwin, proposed
   different aspects of what later would become evolutionary theory. But
   evolution did not reach the status of being a scientific theory until
   Darwin’s grandson, the more famous Charles Darwin, published his famous
   book On the Origin of Species. Darwin and a scientific contemporary of
   his, Alfred Russel Wallace, proposed that evolution occurs because of a
   phenomenon called natural selection.

   In the theory of natural selection, organisms produce more offspring
   than are able to survive in their environment. Those that are better
   physically equipped to survive, grow to maturity, and reproduce. Those
   that are lacking in such fitness, on the other hand, either do not
   reach an age when they can reproduce or produce fewer offspring than
   their counterparts. Natural selection is sometimes summed up as
   “survival of the fittest” because the “fittest” organisms—those most
   suited to their environment—are the ones that reproduce most
   successfully, and are most likely to pass on their traits to the next
   generation.

   This means that if an environment changes, the traits that enhance
   survival in that environment will also gradually change, or evolve.
   Natural selection was such a powerful idea in explaining the evolution
   of life that it became established as a scientific theory. Biologists
   have since observed numerous examples of natural selection influencing
   evolution. Today, it is known to be just one of several mechanisms by
   which life evolves. For example, a phenomenon known as genetic drift
   can also cause species to evolve. In genetic drift, some
   organisms—purely by chance—produce more offspring than would be
   expected. Those organisms are not necessarily the fittest of their
   species, but it is their genes that get passed on to the next
   generation.

   Idea for Use in the Classroom

   Introduce and share the infographic with students. Define key ideas
   such as natural selection, inheritance, and DNA. These activities can
   be done as in-class assignments, small group work, or they can be
   completed outside of class time. Introduce students to Charles Darwin’s
   research, Gregor Mendel’s work with pea plants, and James Watson and
   Francis Crick’s determination of the structure of DNA.

   Darwin Challenged

   Have students work in pairs to research the scientists and ideas that
   were used to challenge Darwin’s theory about the role of natural
   selection. Ask the pairs to choose one scientist or idea and make a
   poster that explains why that scientist thinks Darwin is wrong. Then
   have students write a response from Charles Darwin explaining why his
   theory of natural selection is correct.

   Lucy

   Have students search to find a tree of life diagram of human evolution.
   Ask students to identify where “Lucy” fits into the tree. Then ask
   students to research Lucy and write a short paragraph describing why
   she is an important find.

   Darwin’s Finches

   Have students work in groups to research the finches Darwin studied in
   the Galapagos. Have the groups select one type of finch and explain how
   its beak adapted through natural selection to gather its food.
   Encourage the groups to build models to demonstrate how the shape of
   the beak is best suited for obtaining certain types of food. Have the
   groups present their demonstration to the class.

   Tweeting Science

   Ask students to read through the timeline and select one of the
   entries. Then have them research that entry to learn more about how the
   discovery came about and what it adds to our understanding of
   evolution. After research, have students summarize how the entry
   supports the legacy of an idea by writing a 280-character tweet that
   announces the evidence.

   Natural Selection

   Tell students that Darwin, along with another scientist, Alfred Russel
   Wallace, were the first to propose the idea of evolution through
   natural selection. Today, this idea is widely accepted by scientists.
   Have students research and devise a demonstration of how natural
   selection works in plants or animals. Have students select a
   demonstration that they can present to the class.

   Properly understood, evolution is a scientific theory about the
   development of life and is consistent with Christian theology.

   Properly understood, evolution is a scientific theory about the
   development of life and is consistent with Christian theology.

Introduction

   Providing a definition of “evolution” is tricky because the word is
   used in different ways. First we need to distinguish between the
   broader worldview some associate with evolution and the scientific
   theory of evolution.

evolution as worldview

   Some people consider evolution to be equivalent to atheism, thinking it
   replaces God or otherwise rules out God’s involvement in the
   development of life. But that is a philosophical or worldview position
   (sometimes called “evolutionism” or simply “naturalism”), not a
   strictly scientific position.

   At BioLogos, we are against evolutionism and instead hold to the
   worldview of Christian theism. We call our position on origins
   “evolutionary Creation.” That is to say, we believe God is the Creator
   and also accept that evolution is the best scientific description for
   how life has developed. This is similar to saying we believe God
   provides for the growth and development of plants while we also accept
   that the theory of photosynthesis is the best scientific explanation
   for that process.

evolution as a scientific theory

   In non-scientific contexts, “theory” usually means something like a
   guess (e.g., I have a theory about…). But in its scientific sense, a
   theory is a tested and well-confirmed explanation for a set of
   observations. The observations explained by the theory of evolution
   come primarily from the fossil record, comparative morphology,
   biogeography, and now most importantly, genetics. evolution does not
   attempt to give a scientific explanation for the origin of life, but
   only for the development and diversification of lifeforms after the
   first life began.

   The theory of evolution states that all the lifeforms on earth share a
   common ancestor as a result of variation and selection over a very long
   time (currently thought to be around 4 billion years). Variation means
   that offspring are not exact replicas of their parents, and selection
   occurs when only some of those offspring go on to produce more of their
   own offspring. Common ancestry does not mean the species we find today
   have evolved from each other—dogs did not evolve from cats, and humans
   did not evolve from chimpanzees. Instead, if you go back far enough in
   the ancestral tree of any two organisms, common ancestry predicts that
   you’ll come to a “grandparent” of which both current organisms are
   descendants. For humans and our closest relatives the chimpanzees, you
   have to go back around 300,000 generations to find that common ancestor
   (that would be your 299,998th-great grandparent!). What did that
   process look like?
   Chimpanzee and her baby

   That ancient population (which was neither human nor chimpanzee) split
   into two groups, and these groups were reproductively isolated—that is,
   the members of each group only mated with other members of the their
   own group. Then over the many generations of offspring, different
   variations were preserved in each group. Eventually the characteristics
   of each group were different enough for scientists to recognize them as
   different species. The theory of evolution claims that a similar story
   could be told for the ancestral lineage of any two species that have
   ever lived.

Debates about evolution

   There is very little debate in the scientific community about this
   broad characterization of evolution (anyone who claims otherwise is
   either uninformed or deliberately trying to mislead). The observational
   evidence explained by common ancestry is overwhelming. Of course new
   data causes scientists to adjust some of the specifics (like how long
   ago species diverged, or which species are most closely related), but
   this core view is overwhelmingly supported and agreed upon by the vast
   majority of scientists in the field.

   But that is not to say there are no debates and controversies about
   evolution among those who accept this core view of the theory.
   evolutionary scientists debate the extent to which the variation
   element is explained by random genetic mutations, and how important
   other selection mechanisms are beyond reproductive fitness. Scientists
   have different views on topics like how gradual evolutionary change is
   and on the details of how natural selection works. And as we’ve already
   seen, there are significant differences of opinion about how to
   interpret various aspects of evolution with respect to worldviews, such
   as whether there is overall direction to evolution, and what the
   significance of evolution is for theology.

   At BioLogos we believe the best contemporary science is consistent with
   Christian theology. Find more information on evolution and the BioLogos
   perspective on origins in the other resources on this page or by

   Country Coordinating Mechanisms are core to the Global Fund’s
   contribution to health governance to help end HIV, tuberculosis and
   malaria while investing in resilient and sustainable systems for
   health. The CCM evolution Strategic Initiative is a catalytic
   opportunity to enhance the way our partnership works in countries and
   regions. The approach and methodology build from a pilot phase in
   2018-2019.

Objectives

   Oversight
   Engagement
   Positioning
   Operations
   Transition
   Regional coordination

   The objective of CCM evolution is to equip CCMs to facilitate inclusive
   oversight and meaningful engagement in alignment with national
   structures for sustained health governance. As tested in the pilot,
   this involves increased focus on four core responsibilities:
     * Oversight: Active oversight of existing and emerging investments
     * Engagement: Meaningful, inclusive and active participation of key
       stakeholders
     * Positioning: Working within national structures and existing
       emerging platforms to increase efficiency of health investments
     * Operations: CCM Secretariats’ core functions (including the code of
       conduct), enabling and sustaining health governance

Anticipated Results

   The anticipated results are to change business as usual, leveraging the
   opportunity of the strategic initiative to enhance CCMs, streamline
   processes and invest in results – strengthening governance for existing
   and emerging health challenges.

Implementation

   Implementation is being rolled out in waves through 2021. Steps,
   timelines and more information are in our overview materials:

       Fund Strategy
     * 2020-2022 Allocation: Sources and Uses of Funds

Pilot

   The CCM evolution started in 2018 with a pilot phase in 18 countries.
   The pilot focused on sustainably strengthening CCM performance in four
   areas: overseeing grants, ensuring linkages with national structures,
   engaging key stakeholders and strengthening how CCMs function. The
   results and lessons learned from the pilot were presented to the Global
   Fund Board and committees and serve as the foundation for the global
   implementation of CCM evolution. In 2019 the Board approved a US$15
   million strategic initiative to support the implementation.

Human evolution

   Wanting to understand who we are, where we come from and how we evolved
   is part of what makes us human.

   This an exciting time to be examining human evolution. Intriguing
   fossil and archaeological discoveries, combined with innovative
   techniques and DNA research, are transforming scientists' understanding
   of our ancient past.

   We now know of more than 20 hominin species that are part of our family
   tree. At least half of these species are based on fossils unearthed in
   the last 30 years.

   Museum scientists are at the forefront of research on the migration,
   characteristics and capabilities of these early human relatives, and
   the origin and cultural development of our species, Homo sapiens.

   Trace the evolution of humans since our lineage split from that of
   chimpanzees, explore what we have in common with our ancient relatives
   and discover research that is helping to answer questions about our
   past and future.

Human evolution

   Human evolution is the lengthy process of change by which people
   originated from apelike ancestors. Scientific evidence shows that the
   physical and behavioral traits shared by all people originated from
   apelike ancestors and evolved over a period of approximately six
   million years.

   One of the earliest defining human traits, bipedalism -- the ability to
   walk on two legs -- evolved over 4 million years ago. Other important
   human characteristics -- such as a large and complex brain, the ability
   to make and use tools, and the capacity for language -- developed more
   recently. Many advanced traits -- including complex symbolic
   expression, art, and elaborate cultural diversity -- emerged mainly
   during the past 100,000 years.

   Humans are primates. Physical and genetic similarities show that the
   modern human species, Homo sapiens, has a very close relationship to
   another group of primate species, the apes. Humans and the great apes
   (large apes) of Africa -- chimpanzees (including bonobos, or so-called
   “pygmy chimpanzees”) and gorillas -- share a common ancestor that lived
   between 8 and 6 million years ago. Humans first evolved in Africa, and
   much of human evolution occurred on that continent. The fossils of
   early humans who lived between 6 and 2 million years ago come entirely
   from Africa.

   Most scientists currently recognize some 15 to 20 different species of
   early humans. Scientists do not all agree, however, about how these
   species are related or which ones simply died out. Many early human
   species -- certainly the majority of them – left no living descendants.
   Scientists also debate over how to identify and classify particular
   species of early humans, and about what factors influenced the
   evolution and extinction of each species.

   Early humans first migrated out of Africa into Asia probably between 2
   million and 1.8 million years ago. They entered Europe somewhat later,
   between 1.5 million and 1 million years. Species of modern humans
   populated many parts of the world much later. For instance, people
   first came to Australia probably within the past 60,000 years and to
   the Americas within the past 30,000 years or so. The beginnings of
   agriculture and the rise of the first civilizations occurred within the
   past 12,000 years.


Paleoanthropology

   Paleoanthropology is the scientific study of human evolution.
   Paleoanthropology is a subfield of anthropology, the study of human
   culture, society, and biology. The field involves an understanding of
   the similarities and differences between humans and other species in
   their genes, body form, physiology, and behavior. Paleoanthropologists
   search for the roots of human physical traits and behavior. They seek
   to discover how evolution has shaped the potentials, tendencies, and
   limitations of all people. For many people, paleoanthropology is an
   exciting scientific field because it investigates the origin, over
   millions of years, of the universal and defining traits of our species.
   However, some people find the concept of human evolution troubling
   because it can seem not to fit with religious and other traditional
   beliefs about how people, other living things, and the world came to
   be. Nevertheless, many people have come to reconcile their beliefs with
   the scientific evidence.

   Early human fossils and archeological remains offer the most important
   clues about this ancient past. These remains include bones, tools and
   any other evidence (such as footprints, evidence of hearths, or
   butchery marks on animal bones) left by earlier people. Usually, the
   remains were buried and preserved naturally. They are then found either
   on the surface (exposed by rain, rivers, and wind erosion) or by
   digging in the ground. By studying fossilized bones, scientists learn
   about the physical appearance of earlier humans and how it changed.
   Bone size, shape, and markings left by muscles tell us how those
   predecessors moved around, held tools, and how the size of their brains
   changed over a long time. Archeological evidence refers to the things
   earlier people made and the places where scientists find them. By
   studying this type of evidence, archeologists can understand how early
   humans made and used tools and lived in their environments.


The process of evolution

   The process of evolution involves a series of natural changes that
   cause species (populations of different organisms) to arise, adapt to
   the environment, and become extinct. All species or organisms have
   originated through the process of biological evolution. In animals that
   reproduce sexually, including humans, the term species refers to a
   group whose adult members regularly interbreed, resulting in fertile
   offspring -- that is, offspring themselves capable of reproducing.
   Scientists classify each species with a unique, two-part scientific
   name. In this system, modern humans are classified as Homo sapiens.

   evolution occurs when there is change in the genetic material -- the
   chemical molecule, DNA -- which is inherited from the parents, and
   especially in the proportions of different genes in a population. Genes
   represent the segments of DNA that provide the chemical code for
   producing proteins. Information contained in the DNA can change by a
   process known as mutation. The way particular genes are expressed –
   that is, how they influence the body or behavior of an organism -- can
   also change. Genes affect how the body and behavior of an organism
   develop during its life, and this is why genetically inherited
   characteristics can influence the likelihood of an organism’s survival
   and reproduction.

   evolution does not change any single individual. Instead, it changes
   the inherited means of growth and development that typify a population
   (a group of individuals of the same species living in a particular
   habitat). Parents pass adaptive genetic changes to their offspring, and
   ultimately these changes become common throughout a population. As a
   result, the offspring inherit those genetic characteristics that
   enhance their chances of survival and ability to give birth, which may
   work well until the environment changes. Over time, genetic change can
   alter a species' overall way of life, such as what it eats, how it
   grows, and where it can live. Human evolution took place as new genetic
   variations in early ancestor populations favored new abilities to adapt
   to environmental change and so altered the human way of life.
