   From Check This Out

   Biological evolution is the supposed process by which the first cell
   evolved into the diversity of life we see today. Natural selection and
   mutations are considered its driving force; however, evolution has
   never been observed despite numerous protestations to the contrary.
   Natural selection and mutations cannot add the information necessary to
   change one kind of organism into another. And it doesn’t take a science
   degree to understand why molecules-to-man evolution is impossible.

evolution Defined: “Macro vs. Micro” evolution

   evolution is a word that is used a lot but is poorly defined.
   evolutionists themselves frequently equivocate on the term, using it to
   mean multiple things, sometimes even within the same sentence.

   “Macroevolution” is used to describe the large-scale changes believed
   to be able to turn a blob of protoplasm into a person. By contrast,
   “microevolution” is intended to describe the small-scale changes in
   populations, such as those exhibited by Darwin’s finches—the finch
   populations change beak sizes regularly in response to environmental
--
   take place.

   Since the term evolution is so strongly associated with the
   particles-to-people myth, we tend to use the word speciation to explain
   adaptation and variation within the created kinds, such as that
   exhibited by the finches.Because the small-scale changes generally lead
   to a loss of genetic information rather than a gain of new information
   needed to create new traits like arms and eyes, microevolution can
   never lead to macroevolution. evolutionists tend to use these ideas
   interchangeably. For this reason, we avoid those terms, preferring to
   speak of speciation within created kinds (which we can observe and
   verify) and molecules-to-man evolution (which is unobservable and
   unverifiable).
   History Of evolution

History of evolution: Charles Darwin and Others

   Many people believe that evolution began with Charles Darwin in 1859.
   This belief, however, is inaccurate. evolution as an idea has existed
   since at least the Greek philosophers. A Frenchman named Jean-Baptiste
   Lamarck had proposed a form of evolution in the early 1800s. In fact,
   Darwin’s grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, engraved a Latin motto on his
   coach and book plates meaning “Everything from Shells,” indicating his
   belief in evolution.

   Darwin built on past ideas and added his own wrinkle, one he borrowed
--
   to add millions of years into the Bible. The influence of Chalmers and
   others like him caused many in the church to unquestioningly accept
   millions of years and some to even add Darwin’s evolutionary ideas into
   the Bible.

evolutionary Thought Since Darwin

   Since Darwin’s time, evolution has become the dominant dogma in the
   sciences, even in seemingly unrelated areas. It is impossible to go to
   a secular school and not get overdosed with evolutionary teaching. The
   base model of the dogma has changed very little since Darwin.

   evolutionists still teach that man evolved from apelike creatures over
   millions of years. Other aspects of the idea have been filled in so
   that the evolutionary skeleton looks a little more complete, at least
   for public consumption. However, digging beneath the surface reveals
   things are not well in the evolutionary dogma.

   evolution became permanently immortalized in American culture in 1925
   in what was termed the “Scopes Monkey Trial” in Tennessee. Attempting
   to challenge a Tennessee state law that forbade teaching human
   evolution, the ACLU prompted a substitute teacher named John Scopes to
   admit to breaking the law, even though he later acknowledged he had
   never done so. The trial took on monumental proportions when two of the

   Genetic Challenge

The Genetic Challenge to Classic Darwinian evolution

   Darwin had no knowledge of genetics, even though Mendel’s
   groundbreaking work on genetics was published during his lifetime. When
   genetics made its way into mainstream science, evolutionists adapted
   Darwin’s ideas to fit the emerging study of genetics, forming what is
   called the Modern Synthesis of Darwinian evolution, or neo-Darwinism.
   Most evolutionists today are adherents of neo-Darwinism to one extent
   or another. Neo-Darwinism emphasizes four major forces: gene flow,
   genetic drift, natural selection, and mutations. From these four

   Natural selection is the primary mover in the evolutionary dogma.
   Natural selection allows organisms that are best suited to their
   environment to survive and pass on their genetics with greater

   in.

   evolutionists regard mutations as the force that creates new variation.
   While they acknowledge that mutations almost always remove genetic
   potential, they believe that on rare occasions a mutation will occur
--
How Mutations Work in Real Life

   But the observable facts do not fit evolutionists’ dogma. Natural
   selection does happen, but it works just as Blyth envisioned it did: as
   a preservative, weeding out the worst mutations to preserve the health
   of a population. Scientists acknowledge natural selection is not the
   same as evolution. Mutations likewise occur, but most if not all
   mutations described as beneficial are only beneficial in certain, often
   unusual, situations.

   Antibiotic resistant bacteria is an often-cited example of evolution in
   action by means of mutation and natural selection. Antibiotic
   resistance already existed in bacterial populations before they were

   Information requires an intelligent source, since it requires not only
   data but also the ability to decode that data. This alone is enough to
   refute evolution because there’s no way for a fish to become an
   amphibian without new information.
   Origin of Life

The Origin of Life in Darwinian evolution

   Any ideas about how life could have started on earth overlook one
--
   While Darwin himself never addressed the origin of the universe and
   rarely touched on the origin of life, both are key aspects of
   evolutionary dogma. While many evolutionists attempt to distance
   themselves from these, particularly the origin-of-life question, both
   are fundamentally necessary for evolution to be true. Since most
   evolutionists insist on a naturalistic explanation for everything, the
   origin of life and origin of the universe are both fundamental
   questions evolutionists must answer to support their dogma and a
   naturalistic worldview.

   The origin-of-life question has troubled evolutionists for decades. In
   Darwin’s day, the internal workings of the cell were completely
   unknown. It was easy to speculate about the origin of something
--
   structures needed for life.

The Fossil-Record Problem for evolution

   The fossil record is regularly trotted out as containing the finest
   examples of evolutionary changes in organisms. Yet within the
   evolutionist community itself, there was a massive schism in the 1970s
   when the late Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge proposed the idea of
   punctuated equilibrium. This idea acknowledged a virtual absence of
   transitional forms in the fossil record and proposed that evolution was
   not a gradual process. Instead, it was a jerky, jumpy process that
   mostly involved stasis before great leaps of change. While less common
--
   forms in the fossil record.

   evolutionists prop up their dogma by claiming the earth is millions or
   even billions of years old. The most common proof of these great ages
   is radiometric dating. It is not carbon-14 dating, despite Hollywood
--
   rocks.

   Very little of what evolutionists present as evidence for their dogma
   is good science. In fact, the mere idea of naturalistic evolution is
   anti-science. If evolution were true and if a random chance process
   created the world, then that same process of chance created the human
   brain and its powers of logic. If the brain and its use of logic came
   about by chance, why trust its conclusions? To be consistent,
   evolutionists should reject their own ability to reason logically. Of
   course if they did that, they would have to reject their own dogma as
   well, compelling them to accept a creator. evolution is a self-refuting
   religion.

   The types of changes evolution requires would be expected to provide
   many examples of missing links in virtually every layer of the geologic
   record. This is not the case. The geologic record is better explained

   Christian Theology

evolution’s Effects on Christian Theology

   Unfortunately, as in Darwin’s day, much of the church has accepted
   millions of years and evolution as fact, without ever considering the
   underlying assumptions or how the acceptance of these assumptions
   undermines the biblical text and the gospel.

   For example, consider what happens when you attempt to add evolution
   into the Bible. Adam and Eve are no longer the first humans, and
   original sin goes out the window. This does irreparable damage to the
--
   that Christ is the last Adam, come to redeem us from the sin brought
   into the world through the first man, Adam (1 Corinthians 15:22, 45).
   If Adam were a mythical figure, which is what evolution demands, even
   in a Christianized form, the entire parallel between the two Adams and
   the kinsman redeemer concept is destroyed. By advocating evolution,
   theistic evolutionists are undermining the very tenets of Christianity.

   Those Christians who reject evolution but accept millions of years have
   an equivalent problem. Jesus, when explaining marriage to the
   Sadducees, referred to Adam and Eve as existing from the beginning of
--

   God tells us in Genesis exactly how he created the world, and even the
   order of events doesn’t match the evolutionary tale. In addition, one
   of the things that drives evolution is death. But the Bible teaches
   that death was introduced into the perfect world as a result of Adam’s
   sin. When Christians try to reinterpret God’s infallible Word based on
   the ideas of fallible men, it undermines the gospel of Jesus Christ.
   Answers For evolutionists

evolution and the Flood

   Further, attempting to combine evolution or millions of years with the
   biblical text forces Christians to reject the reality of the global
   flood of Noah’s day. If the fossil record was laid down before man,
--
   and the concept of biblical inerrancy.

   evolution, whether couched in Christianized language or presented in
   its natural atheistic colors, remains an utterly bankrupt and failed
   hypothesis about the origin of the universe or the diversity of life on
   earth. In no instance has cosmological, geological, or biological
   evolution been demonstrated, and the most common evidences for
   evolution all have been debunked. Attempting to add evolution to
   Christianity is both unbiblical and irrational, since evolution itself
   is not science but anti-science. Neither the Bible nor empirical
   science support its claims.

evolution Requires Faith

   For many, a belief in evolution comes from the desire to remove the
   need for God as Creator. Some would say evolution comes from what the
   evidence says to us. But evidence never speaks for itself, it’s always
   interpreted using your assumptions and starting points. And only when

   evolution is rooted in the belief system of naturalism that doesn’t
   allow for anything outside the laws of nature to explain how our world
   operates. Ironically, naturalism requires the violation of several

   God as their Creator and Organizer requires an immense amount of faith.
   While it is often used as a criticism of Christians, those who have an
   evolutionary worldview must accept all of these things by blind faith
   since there is no naturalistic explanation for the existence of these
   laws. While Christians also accept certain truths by faith, it is faith

     * Bad Design
       Some structures seem to show less-than-optimal design, and to some
       evolutionists this proves there is no creator. But a universe that
       has been cursed with degeneration for over 6,000 years won't
       maintain optimal design. The fact that we continue to survive is
       evidence of how good the original design was.
     * Vestigial Organs and Junk DNA
       evolutionists claim that humans and other animals have organs and
       DNA leftover from evolution. But these reports are often based on
       evolutionary expectations. The appendix, for example, was once
       thought vestigial, but now we know its function. Even a true loss

       Even if every single person accepted an idea, that doesn’t make the

       of scientists, creationist and not, who do not find the supposed
       evidence for evolution to be valid or convincing.

   Charles Darwin did not use the word evolution at all in his first

   verb evolved at the very end of the book. Darwin preferred descent with
   modification, because the idea of progress had no place in his theory
   or work. It was his contemporary Herbert Spencer who, embracing
   Darwin's work, popularized evolution in its biological sense and also
   extended the word into ethics, philosophy, and sociology.

   Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection assumed that tiny
   adaptations occur in organisms constantly over millions of years.
   Gradually, a new species develops that is distinct from its ancestors.
   In the 1970s, however, biologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould
   proposed that evolution by natural selection may not have been such a
   smooth and consistent process. Based on fossils from around the world
   that showed the abrupt appearance of new species, Eldredge and Gould

   evolution

   The Washington Post / Getty

   evolution is the way living organisms change over time, driven by
   natural selection.

   A revolutionary insight put forward by Charles Darwin in On the Origin
   of Species in 1859, the concept of natural selection was also touted by
   another British naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, who had come up with
   the idea at the same time.

   The two men hit upon a mechanism for evolution: all organisms vary and
   some variations are more beneficial than others, helping individuals
   thrive and preferentially pass them on to the next generation. In other
--
   rediscovered, genes were identified as units arranged along the
   chromosomes inside the cell’s nucleus. And in 1937, the “modern
   synthesis” brought these ideas together, defining evolution in genetic
   terms as the “change in the frequency of an allele [gene variant]
   within a gene pool”.
--

   Though it was made famous by Darwin, the idea of evolution actually
   predates him. By the early 19th century, developments in geology and
   mining had revealed Earth to be inconceivably ancient. It was also
--
   lived on it. One of the first people to try to explain how new species
   formed was Erasmus Darwin, Charles’s grandfather. Another influential
   early evolutionist was the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck,
   whose “transmutation of species” theory famously argued that change
   occurs when characteristics acquired during an organism’s lifetime are
   passed on to its offspring.

   In recent years, the theory of evolution itself has evolved. The idea
   that it is entirely driven by natural selection is challenged by new
   discoveries in genetics, epigenetics and developmental biology. There
--
   development and heredity, and that organisms play active roles in their
   own fate and that of their descendants. As a result, a growing number
   of biologists believe we need to extend our ideas of how evolution
   works.

   evolution also faces a challenge from the rise of the religious
   creationist movement, which believes in the Bible’s account of the
   origins of life of Earth, and rejects evolution on this basis.

evolution of the eye

   They appeared in an evolutionary blink and changed the rules of life
   for ever. Before eyes, life was gentler and tamer, dominated by
   sluggish soft-bodied creatures lolling around in the sea. The invention
   of the eye ushered in a more brutal and competitive world. Vision made
   it possible for animals to become active hunters, and sparked an
   evolutionary arms race that transformed the planet.

   When did eyes evolve?
--

   The complexity of the eye has long been an evolutionary battleground.
   Ever since William Paley came up with the watchmaker analogy in 1802 –
   which claimed that something as complex as a watch must have a maker –
--

   Charles Darwin was well aware of the argument. In On the Origin of
   Species he admitted that eyes were so complex that their evolution
   seemed “absurd to the highest degree”. But he went on to convincingly
   argue that it only seemed absurd. Complex eyes could have evolved from
--
   possible path from simple to sophisticated.

   Those intermediate forms have now been found. According to evolutionary
   biologists, it would have taken less than half a million years for the
   most rudimentary eye to evolve into a complex “camera” eye like ours.
--
   freshwater creatures related to jellyfish. They have no eyes but will
   contract into a ball when exposed to bright light. Hydras are
   interesting from an evolutionary perspective because their basic
   light-sensing equipment is very similar to that seen in other
   evolutionary lineages, including mammals. It is based on two types of
   protein: opsins, which change shape when light strikes them, and ion
   channels, which respond to the shape-shifting by generating an
   electrical signal. Genetic research suggests that all opsin/ion channel
   systems evolved from a common ancestor similar to hydras, pointing to a
   single evolutionary origin of all visual systems.

   The next step is to evolve a small depression containing the
--
   animal before. Unsurprisingly, their victims counter-evolved. Just a
   few million years later, eyes were everywhere and animals were more
   active and bristling with armour. This burst of evolutionary innovation
   is what we now know as the Cambrian Explosion.

   Why hasn’t evolution given us eyes in the back of our head or rear-view
   mirrors?

--

   You can look at it another way. Rear vision is useful only if potential
   threats are visible. During human evolution, that was most often not
   the case.

   There are various aspects to this question. First, it supposes
   evolution works towards particular goals in a planned way, but that
   isn’t the case.

12,000 years of landscape evolution in the southern White Mountains, New
Hampshire, as recorded in Ossipee Lake sediments

--
   Continuous records of sediment yield spanning from the late glacial
   through the Holocene to the present day provide an important
   opportunity to investigate landscape evolution over various timescales
   in response to a variety of natural and anthropogenic forcing
   mechanisms. This study investigates variations in sediment yield and
   landscape evolution in the 768 km2 watershed of Ossipee Lake, New
   Hampshire, USA. We pair subbottom sonar observations with analyses of
   lacustrine sediment cores to interpret a 12,000+ yr record of lake
   sedimentation in terms of changes in sediment yield and landscape
   evolution. Our results indicate high rates of sediment redistribution
   following deglaciation at ~14,500 to ~12,000 cal yr BP, followed by a
   period of gradually decreasing sediment yield until ~9000 cal yr BP,

   Donald Hoffman claims to have used the theory of evolution by natural

   but an interface with it (3 August, p 34). He says evolution itself may
   be just an interface projection of deeper dynamics stemming from a
   network of conscious agents. But such agents arrive late in the fossil
   record, so how could evolution arise before they existed?

   claim that nothing we perceive resembles reality and we are “born with

   simplify things so we had “what we need to play the game of life”, and
   that what we perceive is an abstract data structure that represents
   something that “doesn’t even exist in space and time”. The implication
   that evolution therefore doesn’t occur in space and time creates
   problems for me. Hoffman goes on to say that evolution has shaped us to
   see things that we have to take seriously, to see what we need to stay
   alive, but that “does not, logically, permit us to say that we’re

evolution might stop humans from solving climate change, researchers say

   evolution might stop humans from solving climate change, says new study
   Dimensions of environmental management create an attractor landscape
   for long-term human evolution. Environmental sustainability challenges
   (curved frontiers) require a minimum level of cooperation in a society
   of a certain minimum spatial size. Alternative potential paths move
   humanity toward different long-term evolutionary outcomes. In path B,

   exploit natural resources that were refined over thousands of years
   through the process of cultural adaptation to the environment.
   University of Maine evolutionary biologist Tim Waring wanted to know
   how this process of cultural adaptation to the environment might
   influence the goal of solving global environmental problems. What he
--

   The project sought to understand three core questions: how human
   evolution has operated in the context of environmental resources, how
   human evolution has contributed to the multiple global environmental
   crises, and how global environmental limits might change the outcomes
   of human evolution in the future.

   Waring's team outlined their findings in a new paper published in
--

   The study explored how human societies' use of the environment changed
   over our evolutionary history. The research team investigated changes
   in the ecological niche of human populations, including factors such as
   the natural resources they used, how intensively they were used, what
--
   social systems for managing each of these.

   "Human evolution is mostly driven by cultural change, which is faster
   than genetic evolution. That greater speed of adaptation has made it
   possible for humans to colonize all habitable land worldwide," says
   Waring, associate professor with the UMaine Senator George J. Mitchell

   societies, not between them. For example, managing regional water
   systems requires regional cooperation, regional infrastructure and
   technology, and these arise through regional cultural evolution. The
   presence of societies of the right scale is therefore a critical
   limiting factor.
--

   The other problem is much worse, Waring says. In a world filled with
   sub-global groups, cultural evolution among these groups will tend to
   solve the wrong problems, benefiting the interests of nations and
   corporations and delaying action on shared priorities. Cultural
   evolution among groups would tend to exacerbate resource competition
   and could lead to direct conflict between groups and even global human
   dieback.
--
   solve than previously considered," says Waring. "It's not just that
   they are the hardest thing our species has ever done. They absolutely
   are. The bigger problem is that central features in human evolution are
   likely working against our ability to solve them. To solve global
   collective challenges we have to swim upstream."
--

   Waring and his colleagues think that their analysis can help navigate
   the future of human evolution on a limited Earth. Their paper is the
   first to propose that human evolution may oppose the emergence of
   collective global problems and further research is needed to develop
   and test this theory.

   Waring's team proposes several applied research efforts to better
   understand the drivers of cultural evolution and search for ways to
   reduce global environmental competition, given how human evolution
   works. For example, research is needed to document the patterns and
   strength of human cultural evolution in the past and present. Studies
   could focus on the past processes that lead to the human domination of
   the biosphere, and on the ways cultural adaptation to the environment
   is occurring today.

   But if the general outline proves to be correct, and human evolution
   tends to oppose collective solutions to global environmental problems,
   as the authors suggest, then some very pressing questions need to be
--
   As for whether humans can continue to survive on a limited planet,
   Waring says, "We don't have any solutions for this idea of a long-term
   evolutionary trap, as we barely understand the problem. If our
   conclusions are even close to being correct, we need to study this much
   more carefully."

Theory of evolution

   The theory of evolution is a shortened form of the term “theory of
   evolution by natural selection,” which was proposed by Charles Darwin
   and Alfred Russel Wallace in the nineteenth century.

   the word, because it could not be subjected to testing that might
   support it or prove it wrong. In science, the word “theory” indicates a
   very high level of certainty. Scientists talk about evolution as a
   theory, for instance, just as they talk about Einstein’s explanation of
   gravity as a theory.
--
   A theory is an idea about how something in nature works that has gone
   through rigorous testing through observations and experiments designed
   to prove the idea right or wrong. When it comes to the evolution of
   life, various philosophers and scientists, including an
   eighteenth-century English doctor named Erasmus Darwin, proposed
   different aspects of what later would become evolutionary theory. But
   evolution did not reach the status of being a scientific theory until
   Darwin’s grandson, the more famous Charles Darwin, published his famous
   book On the Origin of Species. Darwin and a scientific contemporary of
   his, Alfred Russel Wallace, proposed that evolution occurs because of a
   phenomenon called natural selection.

--
   This means that if an environment changes, the traits that enhance
   survival in that environment will also gradually change, or evolve.
   Natural selection was such a powerful idea in explaining the evolution
   of life that it became established as a scientific theory. Biologists
   have since observed numerous examples of natural selection influencing
   evolution. Today, it is known to be just one of several mechanisms by
   which life evolves. For example, a phenomenon known as genetic drift
   can also cause species to evolve. In genetic drift, some

   Properly understood, evolution is a scientific theory about the
   development of life and is consistent with Christian theology.

   Properly understood, evolution is a scientific theory about the
   development of life and is consistent with Christian theology.

Introduction

   Providing a definition of “evolution” is tricky because the word is
   used in different ways. First we need to distinguish between the
   broader worldview some associate with evolution and the scientific
   theory of evolution.

evolution as worldview

   Some people consider evolution to be equivalent to atheism, thinking it
   replaces God or otherwise rules out God’s involvement in the
   development of life. But that is a philosophical or worldview position
   (sometimes called “evolutionism” or simply “naturalism”), not a
   strictly scientific position.

   At BioLogos, we are against evolutionism and instead hold to the
   worldview of Christian theism. We call our position on origins
   “evolutionary Creation.” That is to say, we believe God is the Creator
   and also accept that evolution is the best scientific description for
   how life has developed. This is similar to saying we believe God
   provides for the growth and development of plants while we also accept
--
   for that process.

evolution as a scientific theory

   In non-scientific contexts, “theory” usually means something like a
   guess (e.g., I have a theory about…). But in its scientific sense, a
   theory is a tested and well-confirmed explanation for a set of
   observations. The observations explained by the theory of evolution
   come primarily from the fossil record, comparative morphology,
   biogeography, and now most importantly, genetics. evolution does not
   attempt to give a scientific explanation for the origin of life, but
   only for the development and diversification of lifeforms after the
   first life began.

   The theory of evolution states that all the lifeforms on earth share a
   common ancestor as a result of variation and selection over a very long
   time (currently thought to be around 4 billion years). Variation means
--
   variations were preserved in each group. Eventually the characteristics
   of each group were different enough for scientists to recognize them as
   different species. The theory of evolution claims that a similar story
   could be told for the ancestral lineage of any two species that have
   ever lived.

Debates about evolution

   There is very little debate in the scientific community about this
   broad characterization of evolution (anyone who claims otherwise is
   either uninformed or deliberately trying to mislead). The observational
   evidence explained by common ancestry is overwhelming. Of course new
--

   But that is not to say there are no debates and controversies about
   evolution among those who accept this core view of the theory.
   evolutionary scientists debate the extent to which the variation
   element is explained by random genetic mutations, and how important
   other selection mechanisms are beyond reproductive fitness. Scientists
   have different views on topics like how gradual evolutionary change is
   and on the details of how natural selection works. And as we’ve already
   seen, there are significant differences of opinion about how to
   interpret various aspects of evolution with respect to worldviews, such
   as whether there is overall direction to evolution, and what the
   significance of evolution is for theology.

   At BioLogos we believe the best contemporary science is consistent with
   Christian theology. Find more information on evolution and the BioLogos
   perspective on origins in the other resources on this page or by

   From Check This Out

   Biological evolution is the supposed process by which the first cell
   evolved into the diversity of life we see today. Natural selection and
   mutations are considered its driving force; however, evolution has
   never been observed despite numerous protestations to the contrary.
   Natural selection and mutations cannot add the information necessary to
   change one kind of organism into another. And it doesn’t take a science
   degree to understand why molecules-to-man evolution is impossible.

evolution Defined: “Macro vs. Micro” evolution

   evolution is a word that is used a lot but is poorly defined.
   evolutionists themselves frequently equivocate on the term, using it to
   mean multiple things, sometimes even within the same sentence.

   “Macroevolution” is used to describe the large-scale changes believed
   to be able to turn a blob of protoplasm into a person. By contrast,
   “microevolution” is intended to describe the small-scale changes in
   populations, such as those exhibited by Darwin’s finches—the finch
   populations change beak sizes regularly in response to environmental
--
   take place.

   Since the term evolution is so strongly associated with the
   particles-to-people myth, we tend to use the word speciation to explain
   adaptation and variation within the created kinds, such as that
   exhibited by the finches.Because the small-scale changes generally lead
   to a loss of genetic information rather than a gain of new information
   needed to create new traits like arms and eyes, microevolution can
   never lead to macroevolution. evolutionists tend to use these ideas
   interchangeably. For this reason, we avoid those terms, preferring to
   speak of speciation within created kinds (which we can observe and
   verify) and molecules-to-man evolution (which is unobservable and
   unverifiable).
   History Of evolution

History of evolution: Charles Darwin and Others

   Many people believe that evolution began with Charles Darwin in 1859.
   This belief, however, is inaccurate. evolution as an idea has existed
   since at least the Greek philosophers. A Frenchman named Jean-Baptiste
   Lamarck had proposed a form of evolution in the early 1800s. In fact,
   Darwin’s grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, engraved a Latin motto on his
   coach and book plates meaning “Everything from Shells,” indicating his
   belief in evolution.

   Darwin built on past ideas and added his own wrinkle, one he borrowed
--
   to add millions of years into the Bible. The influence of Chalmers and
   others like him caused many in the church to unquestioningly accept
   millions of years and some to even add Darwin’s evolutionary ideas into
   the Bible.

evolutionary Thought Since Darwin

   Since Darwin’s time, evolution has become the dominant dogma in the
   sciences, even in seemingly unrelated areas. It is impossible to go to
   a secular school and not get overdosed with evolutionary teaching. The
   base model of the dogma has changed very little since Darwin.

   evolutionists still teach that man evolved from apelike creatures over
   millions of years. Other aspects of the idea have been filled in so
   that the evolutionary skeleton looks a little more complete, at least
   for public consumption. However, digging beneath the surface reveals
   things are not well in the evolutionary dogma.

   evolution became permanently immortalized in American culture in 1925
   in what was termed the “Scopes Monkey Trial” in Tennessee. Attempting
   to challenge a Tennessee state law that forbade teaching human
   evolution, the ACLU prompted a substitute teacher named John Scopes to
   admit to breaking the law, even though he later acknowledged he had
   never done so. The trial took on monumental proportions when two of the

   Genetic Challenge

The Genetic Challenge to Classic Darwinian evolution

   Darwin had no knowledge of genetics, even though Mendel’s
   groundbreaking work on genetics was published during his lifetime. When
   genetics made its way into mainstream science, evolutionists adapted
   Darwin’s ideas to fit the emerging study of genetics, forming what is
   called the Modern Synthesis of Darwinian evolution, or neo-Darwinism.
   Most evolutionists today are adherents of neo-Darwinism to one extent
   or another. Neo-Darwinism emphasizes four major forces: gene flow,
   genetic drift, natural selection, and mutations. From these four
--
   life on earth.

   Natural selection is the primary mover in the evolutionary dogma.
   Natural selection allows organisms that are best suited to their
   environment to survive and pass on their genetics with greater
--
   in.

   evolutionists regard mutations as the force that creates new variation.
   While they acknowledge that mutations almost always remove genetic
   potential, they believe that on rare occasions a mutation will occur
--
How Mutations Work in Real Life

   But the observable facts do not fit evolutionists’ dogma. Natural
   selection does happen, but it works just as Blyth envisioned it did: as
   a preservative, weeding out the worst mutations to preserve the health
   of a population. Scientists acknowledge natural selection is not the
   same as evolution. Mutations likewise occur, but most if not all
   mutations described as beneficial are only beneficial in certain, often
   unusual, situations.

   Antibiotic resistant bacteria is an often-cited example of evolution in
   action by means of mutation and natural selection. Antibiotic
   resistance already existed in bacterial populations before they were

   Information requires an intelligent source, since it requires not only
   data but also the ability to decode that data. This alone is enough to
   refute evolution because there’s no way for a fish to become an
   amphibian without new information.
   Origin of Life

The Origin of Life in Darwinian evolution

   Any ideas about how life could have started on earth overlook one
--
   While Darwin himself never addressed the origin of the universe and
   rarely touched on the origin of life, both are key aspects of
   evolutionary dogma. While many evolutionists attempt to distance
   themselves from these, particularly the origin-of-life question, both
   are fundamentally necessary for evolution to be true. Since most
   evolutionists insist on a naturalistic explanation for everything, the
   origin of life and origin of the universe are both fundamental
   questions evolutionists must answer to support their dogma and a
   naturalistic worldview.

   The origin-of-life question has troubled evolutionists for decades. In
   Darwin’s day, the internal workings of the cell were completely
   unknown. It was easy to speculate about the origin of something
--
   structures needed for life.

The Fossil-Record Problem for evolution

   The fossil record is regularly trotted out as containing the finest
   examples of evolutionary changes in organisms. Yet within the
   evolutionist community itself, there was a massive schism in the 1970s
   when the late Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge proposed the idea of
   punctuated equilibrium. This idea acknowledged a virtual absence of
   transitional forms in the fossil record and proposed that evolution was
   not a gradual process. Instead, it was a jerky, jumpy process that
   mostly involved stasis before great leaps of change. While less common
--
   forms in the fossil record.

   evolutionists prop up their dogma by claiming the earth is millions or
   even billions of years old. The most common proof of these great ages
   is radiometric dating. It is not carbon-14 dating, despite Hollywood
--
   rocks.

   Very little of what evolutionists present as evidence for their dogma
   is good science. In fact, the mere idea of naturalistic evolution is
   anti-science. If evolution were true and if a random chance process
   created the world, then that same process of chance created the human
   brain and its powers of logic. If the brain and its use of logic came
   about by chance, why trust its conclusions? To be consistent,
   evolutionists should reject their own ability to reason logically. Of
   course if they did that, they would have to reject their own dogma as
   well, compelling them to accept a creator. evolution is a self-refuting
   religion.

   The types of changes evolution requires would be expected to provide
   many examples of missing links in virtually every layer of the geologic
   record. This is not the case. The geologic record is better explained

   Christian Theology

evolution’s Effects on Christian Theology

   Unfortunately, as in Darwin’s day, much of the church has accepted
   millions of years and evolution as fact, without ever considering the
   underlying assumptions or how the acceptance of these assumptions
   undermines the biblical text and the gospel.

   For example, consider what happens when you attempt to add evolution
   into the Bible. Adam and Eve are no longer the first humans, and
   original sin goes out the window. This does irreparable damage to the
--
   that Christ is the last Adam, come to redeem us from the sin brought
   into the world through the first man, Adam (1 Corinthians 15:22, 45).
   If Adam were a mythical figure, which is what evolution demands, even
   in a Christianized form, the entire parallel between the two Adams and
   the kinsman redeemer concept is destroyed. By advocating evolution,
   theistic evolutionists are undermining the very tenets of Christianity.

   Those Christians who reject evolution but accept millions of years have
   an equivalent problem. Jesus, when explaining marriage to the
   Sadducees, referred to Adam and Eve as existing from the beginning of
--

   God tells us in Genesis exactly how he created the world, and even the
   order of events doesn’t match the evolutionary tale. In addition, one
   of the things that drives evolution is death. But the Bible teaches
   that death was introduced into the perfect world as a result of Adam’s
   sin. When Christians try to reinterpret God’s infallible Word based on
   the ideas of fallible men, it undermines the gospel of Jesus Christ.
   Answers For evolutionists

evolution and the Flood

   Further, attempting to combine evolution or millions of years with the
   biblical text forces Christians to reject the reality of the global
   flood of Noah’s day. If the fossil record was laid down before man,
--
   and the concept of biblical inerrancy.

   evolution, whether couched in Christianized language or presented in
   its natural atheistic colors, remains an utterly bankrupt and failed
   hypothesis about the origin of the universe or the diversity of life on
   earth. In no instance has cosmological, geological, or biological
   evolution been demonstrated, and the most common evidences for
   evolution all have been debunked. Attempting to add evolution to
   Christianity is both unbiblical and irrational, since evolution itself
   is not science but anti-science. Neither the Bible nor empirical
   science support its claims.

evolution Requires Faith

   For many, a belief in evolution comes from the desire to remove the
   need for God as Creator. Some would say evolution comes from what the
   evidence says to us. But evidence never speaks for itself, it’s always
   interpreted using your assumptions and starting points. And only when

   God as their Creator and Organizer requires an immense amount of faith.
   While it is often used as a criticism of Christians, those who have an

   since there is no naturalistic explanation for the existence of these
   laws. While Christians also accept certain truths by faith, it is faith

Darwin and His Theory of evolution

   At first glance, Charles Darwin seems an unlikely revolutionary.
   Growing up a shy and unassuming member of a wealthy British family, he
   appeared, at least to his father, to be idle and directionless. But
--
   reflecting on his observations and experiences, and over the next two
   years developed the basic outline of his groundbreaking theory of
   evolution through natural selection. But beyond sharing his ideas with
   a close circle of scientist friends, Darwin told no one of his views on
   the origin and development of life. Indeed, he did not publish his
--
   naturalists, in London on July 1, 1858. The following year, Darwin
   published On the Origin of Species, a lengthy, fleshed-out treatment of
   his ideas on evolutionary theory. The book was an immediate bestseller
   and quickly set off a firestorm of controversy.

   life that has evolved from them.

   This evolution, Darwin wrote, is due to two factors. The first factor,
   Darwin argued, is that each individual animal is marked by subtle
   differences that distinguish it from its parents. Darwin, who called
--
   the scientific communities of the English-speaking world largely
   collapsed in the decades following the publication of On the Origin of
   Species. Yet evolution continued to be vigorously rejected by British
   and American churches because, religious leaders argued, the theory
   directly contradicted many of the core teachings of the Christian
--
   Darwinian thinking also appeared to contradict the notion, central to
   Christianity and many other faiths, that man had a special, God-given
   place in the natural order. Instead, proponents of evolution pointed to
   signs in human anatomy – remnants of a tailbone, for instance – showing
   common ancestry with other mammals.
--
   reportedly asked biologist Thomas Henry Huxley whether he was related
   to an ape on his grandmother’s or grandfather’s side. Huxley, whose
   vigorous defense of evolutionary theory would earn him the nickname
   “Darwin’s bulldog,” allegedly replied that he would rather be the
   ancestor of a monkey than an advanced and intelligent human being who

   occurred. Regardless, it was around this time that the British
   scientific establishment gained the upper hand in the debate over
   evolution. And while the public disagreement between ecclesiastical and
   scientific authorities did not end in the 1860s, religious thinkers
   became more wary of directly challenging evolution on scientific
   grounds. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, churches instead
   focused much of their energy on resisting the idea that man had evolved
   from lower animal orders and hence had no special place in creation or,
   for that matter, a soul. Indeed, while some churches, including the
   Catholic Church, eventually accepted evolution as a God-directed
   mechanism of biological development, none questioned the role of God as
   the sole creator of man.

   Woolly rhinoceros is one of the most popular species of the Ice Age,
   which has been attracting great interests from both the scientific

   evolutionary history of this rhino species, our findings herein
   highlight that ancient DNA sequences from Chinese individuals are very
   important for revealing the full picture of the evolution of woolly
   rhinoceros, which will also have the enlightenment significance for

Abstract

   evolution is both a fact and a theory. evolution is widely observable
   in laboratory and natural populations as they change over time. The
   fact that we need annual flu vaccines is one example of observable
   evolution. At the same time, evolutionary theory explains more than
   observations, as the succession on the fossil record. Hence, evolution
   is also the scientific theory that embodies biology, including all
   organisms and their characteristics. In this paper, we emphasize why
   evolution is the most important theory in biology. evolution explains
   every biological detail, similar to how history explains many aspects
   of a current political situation. Only evolution explains the patterns
   observed in the fossil record. Examples include the succession in the
   fossil record; we cannot find the easily fossilized mammals before 300

   Additionally, the fact that we are able to construct fairly consistent
   phylogenetic trees using distinct genetic markers in the genome is only
   explained by evolutionary theory. Finally, we show that the processes
   that drive evolution, both on short and long time scales, are
   observable facts.

   discovered facts.

evolution as a fact and theory

   evolution is a population concept. An individual does not evolve; only
   populations evolve in the face of the genetic changes accumulated from
   one generation to the next. The flu virus evolves. This explains why
   last years’ flu vaccine does not work on the current strain of the
   virus: only the resistant strains of the virus survived last year’s
   vaccine application. This is a textbook example of evolution by natural
   selection. Genetic modifications are encountered in the resistant
   strains; thus, evolution is a fact (Gould, 1981). Mutation, migration,
   natural selection, and genetic drift are the evolutionary forces that
   drive genetic changes of natural populations from one generation to the
   next. This is known among biologists as microevolution.

   On the other hand, evolutionary theory explains more than those facts
   that we can routinely observe. This makes it a theory, but is it just a
   theory? The word theory has distinct meanings in science and in lay
--
   Furthermore, the more universal the theory, the more robust it becomes
   with time, as more tests would have been performed. According to
   Darwin, evolutionary theory is centred around two points (Darwin,
   1859). First, from one generation to the next, natural populations
   change over time by a process of natural selection. Second, all
   organisms have a common ancestor, and the time since this last common
   ancestor lived is inversely proportional to the similarities that the
   organisms will share today. Hence, evolutionary theory is universal
   because it includes all (living and fossil) biological diversity and
   has implications for all heritable characteristics of life. Since 1859,
   evolutionary theory has become the most universal and, hence, widely
   tested of the scientific theories in biology.

--
   have provided more details on how natural populations evolve. One
   example is the understanding that, at the molecular level, random
   evolution, rather than natural selection, plays the most important role
   (Kimura, 1991). This is known as the neutral theory, which completed
   its 50^th anniversary in 2018.
--
   The substance of Darwin’s original theory, however, remains. Theodosius
   Dobzhansky (1973) shared his astonishment that Charles Darwin proposed
   the theory of evolution without many key biological concepts, such as
   that DNA is the molecule responsible for heredity. Half a century after
   Dobzhansky’s paper, it remains impressive that the theory of evolution
   still stands valid in light of the discoveries of the molecular biology
   revolution. Each newly sequenced genome tests some aspects of Darwin’s
   theory, and, on each case, the sequence has been consistent with
   Darwin’s prediction of the shared evolutionary history of life. The
   sharp increase in scope and universality of evolution has strengthened
   Darwin’s original proposal and made evolutionary theory one of the most
   reliable and tested theories in the natural sciences (National Academy
   of Sciences, 2008).

   Some creationists dispute this information, claiming that scientists
   discredit data that go against evolutionary theory. Nonetheless, there
   is no room for considering worldwide, long-lasting conspiracies in
   science, as scientific fame and recognition come from the demolition of
   old theories, not from adherence to them (Atkins, 1995). Indeed,
   scientists themselves have challenged many aspects of the original
   Darwinian theory of evolution, such as the importance of neutral
   evolution, the discovery of epigenetics, the proposal of punctuated
   equilibrium, etc. When these challenges were first proposed, they were
   not ignored; they were published in top scientific journals and have
--

   Furthermore, if scientists were dishonestly accepting a false theory of
   evolution, Lamarck’s theory of inheritance of acquired characters would
   still be considered valid today. However, it is not. In the XIX
   century, August Weissman (1889) removed the tails of 20 generations of
--
   descendants’ tails. Scientists themselves devised the scientific
   experiment that bluntly rejected Lamarck’s proposal as a mechanism of
   evolution (Dobzhansky, 1973). Scientists do not discredit data that
   goes against evolution; otherwise, Lamarck’s idea would still be
   accepted. They discredit scientific untestable theories and
   explanations that were not gathered using the scientific method.
--
   Just as human history explains the geopolitical configurations of our
   world today, modern biological systems are a direct result of their
   evolutionary past. Hence, evolutionary theory is the cornerstone of the
   discipline of biology (Rutledge and Warden, 2000). The discipline of
   biology today is an instantaneous portrayal of the dynamic evolutionary
   axis that arose with the origin of life and has been changing by
   evolution ever since (Figure 2). With the first life, genetics,
   ecology, biochemistry and evolution began.

   The relationship between evolution and biology. Ever since the origin
   of life, evolutionary processes, such as mutation, selection, and
   genetic drift, are responsible for genetic change in natural and
   laboratory populations. Hence, biology is an instantaneous snap-shot of
   the dynamic evolutionary axis. This simplified figure illustrates some,
   of the many, faunal explosions that have took place since the origin of
   life.

   As a scientific theory, however, which facts does evolutionary theory
   explain? One pivotal example is the succession in the fossil record.
   This evolution, namely, macroevolution, explains the larger
   evolutionary picture that is the appearance of the greater groups, such
   as the evolution of mammals, insects, and plants. Fossilized mammals
   are easily recognized, as they have distinct types of teeth, such as
   molars, canines, and incisors. These vertebrates are also very likely
--
   2013), birds, whales (Thewissen, 2009), horses, and humans. These
   successions in the fossil record are the most obvious evidence to
   macroevolution (Figure 2). In fact, the entire fossil record is a set
   of millions of intermediate fossils that provide solid evidence of how
   macroevolution worked in the past billion years.

evolutionary processes that drive micro and macroevolution are facts

   To have a better understanding of evolution, we must discuss the
   processes that drive evolution. For this, we start by comparing
   processes that drive microevolution with those that drive
   macroevolution. Many of the same evolutionary processes that drive
   microevolution also drive macroevolution, namely natural selection,
   mutation, migration, and genetic drift. A lineage will tend to
   diversify if it has adaptations that increase survival and reproductive
--
   increase population size and the geographical distribution of the
   ancestral species that will more likely speciate into two descendant
   species. Hence, according to this view, macroevolution is
   microevolution on a larger scale (Zimmer, 2001), with biological
   speciation as the only additional process (Russo et al., 2016). Through
   speciation, one ancestral species gives rise to two descendant species
--
   we observe biological species with interbreeding members and
   reproductive isolation between species is compatible with both separate
   creation and macroevolution. So, which observable pattern would we
   expect if many speciation events generated the vast biological
   diversity from a single common ancestor? In this case, we would expect
--
   and a frog. For instance, the cellular respiration is a process shared
   by ferns and frogs and it is an evidence of their common ancestry. Only
   macroevolution explains well the distinct degrees of similarity between
   these four isolated species, as the age of their last common ancestor
   is inversely proportional to the similarity between any two species.
--
   we would expect if all life had a common ancestry.

   Other fossil record patterns are well explained by macroevolution. For
   instance, why do we find a major increase in mammalian fossil diversity
   only after the disappearance of non-avian dinosaurs approximately 65
   million years ago? The same pattern is observed in the fossil record of
   birds. Macroevolution explains this well, as the extinction of
   dinosaurs eliminated competition, and the surviving ancestral mammals
   were able to increase in number and diversified through speciation,
--
   explanation for a natural phenomenon, we eliminate the possibility of
   eventually being able to explain it naturally. Thus, the scientific
   revolution begun when we eliminated the divine as a scientific
   explanation.

   Science, as a process, starts with the acceptance of our ignorance
   about a natural phenomenon and by seeking natural explanations for it.
   Hence, ignorance drives the engine of Science. Even if evolution were,
   hypothetically, rejected, contested by new data, scientists would have
   to study hard to find an alternative natural explanation that was able
   to explain everything that evolution explains today plus the new data
   that contested it.

   evolution is a fact and a well-supported scientific theory. It has
   endured daily and rigorous testing, and it stands as the unifying
   theory in biology (Rutledge and Warden, 2000). This says nothing about
   whether God created or did not create the world, as science is unable
   to distinguish a divinely guided evolution from a materialistic
   evolution. God may well have created the biological world through
   natural selection, mutation, speciation, extinction, etc. Still,
   evolution and Science would remain unscathed as Science is not
   concerned with why or who, but only with how.

   Some creationists say that we must bring the evolution versus
   creationist debate to the classroom and claim that the opposition to
   the debate is anti-scientific. However, science is not about blind
--

   A recent study has suggested that science concepts, more than
   evolutionary basics, are critical to promoting evolution (Dunk et al.,
   2017). One way to reinforce these fundamentals would be the requirement
   of evolution and science fundaments in admission policies for biology
   professionals, particularly teachers (Larkin and Perry-Ryder, 2015; see
   Rutledge and Warden, 2000 for statistics).

Abstract

   Cultural evolution theory has long been inspired by evolutionary
   biology. Conceptual analogies between biological and cultural evolution
   have led to the adoption of a range of formal theoretical approaches
   from population dynamics and genetics. However, this has resulted in a
   research programme with a strong focus on cultural transmission. Here,
   we contrast biological with cultural evolution, and highlight aspects
   of cultural evolution that have not received sufficient attention
   previously. We outline possible implications for evolutionary dynamics
   and argue that not taking them into account will limit our
   understanding of cultural systems. We propose 12 key questions for

   certain cultural practices, there has been a centuries-long effort to
   devise or formulate a general theory of culture. One such approach is
   the application of evolutionary theory to culture. Inspired by Darwin’s
   publication ‘On the Origin of Species’ [4], the idea of taking an
   evolutionary perspective on (human) culture has received considerable
   research interest from scholars in many fields. The popularity of using
   evolutionary terminology when describing cultural change, however, has
   varied considerably over time (for overviews of evolutionary thinking
   in the humanities and social sciences, see [5–10]). This was in part
   due to a lack of understanding of biological evolution but also based
   on the politically motivated misuse of evolutionary theory (see [11]).

   A more recent approach to studying cultural evolution was inspired by
   the quantitative theories that emerged in the life sciences in the
   first half of the twentieth century. They were the direct result of
   major advances in the understanding of the evolutionary process, marked
   by the Modern Synthesis that unified Darwinian evolution with Mendelian
   genetics. These novel formal descriptions of biological transmission
   greatly increased the understanding of biological evolution. The
   theoretical models by Fisher [12], Wright [13] and Haldane [14] cast
   verbal theories and thought experiments in the precise language of
   mathematics, which allowed a systematic analysis of the processes
   involved in and the consequences for biological evolution. Moreover,
   using formal theoretical models has proven useful for extracting the
   most important features from complex processes, by keeping track of
--
   populations of individuals, be it genetic or cultural traits. To
   justify this approach, the authors assumed and outlined structural and
   conceptual analogies between biological and cultural evolution. At an
   abstract level, population-level processes in both domains are
   characterized by the continuous emergence, selective retention, and
   transmission of variation [18–21]. Hence, analogies have been made
   between the forces driving the evolution of genetic traits
   (transmission, mutation, drift and selection) and those driving the
   evolution of cultural traits (transmission, innovation, random
   fluctuations and selection). Additionally, both types are characterized
   by observable phenomena (e.g. an adapted species and cumulative
   culture) that are high-level properties (of a species and a population,
   respectively), which are the result of low-level interactions (at the
   level of individuals). Finally, both biological and cultural evolution
   are cumulative processes. That is, traits evolve successively through
   repeatedly modifying, combining, re-combining and re-purposing existing
--

   In contrast to the aforementioned general similarities, there are
   obvious differences between cultural and biological evolution that
   require mathematical approaches to be adapted [27]. For example, if
   parents exhibit different variants of a cultural trait (e.g. hunting

   In fact, this space is so rich that the overwhelming amount of cultural
   evolution research has primarily focused on cultural transmission. What
   the aforementioned seminal books started has become a rich and vibrant
   research field that has garnered much interest from researchers across
--

   Precisely because of this surge of interest, we believe it is an ideal
   moment to identify potential avenues for future cultural evolution
   research. We believe that there are a number of differences between
   biological and cultural evolution that have still not received
   sufficient attention. We identify specific differences by contrasting
   characteristics of biological and cultural evolution and point out some
   (table 1) that are of special interest. Our analysis mainly focuses on
   unique features of the acquisition, storage, recall and transmission,

2.  Differences between biological and cultural evolution

   In this section, we summarize several important differences between
   biological and cultural evolution, before we discuss implications for
   theories of cultural evolution in the following section. Table 1 is an
   attempt to identify core differences by contrasting various aspects of
   biological and cultural evolution. Some of the listed differences have
   been considered previously [11,15,17,27,34] while others have received
   less attention. We argue that recognizing these differences will affect
   the understanding of cultural evolution in general, and modelling
   approaches in particular, as it is well known that even small changes
   to the mechanisms of dynamical systems can fundamentally change their
--

   It is important to note that (human) cognitive abilities, many unique,
   are a factor in many of the items listed under cultural evolution in
   the table and thus have consequences for the dynamics and outcome of
   cultural evolution. For instance, opportunities for cultural
   recombination and thus generation of new culture is significantly
   enhanced by human thinking, planning and problem-solving abilities.
--
   cultural artefacts and externalized information storage (see §2a). One
   aspect that is not included in the table is processing. While it is
   undoubtedly integral to both biological and cultural evolution, some
   sort of processing is occurring in all items of the table.

--

   The way in which information is stored differs fundamentally between
   cultural and biological evolution. In biological evolution, information
   (genetic traits) is encoded in and stored as the sequence of physical
   molecular structures, the genome. By contrast, in cultural evolution,
   cultural information within individuals (cultural traits) takes the
   form of mental representations, which are encoded as neuronal
--
   flexibility of the nervous system, mental representations can be
   continuously altered before they are exhibited and transmitted to
   others. These differences have consequences for the evolutionary
   dynamics and concerns several of the other items in the table, which we
   will address in §3.
--
   information storage, computation and filtering (and in part creation),
   an increasingly important question is how information technology
   changes cultural evolution as well as our mental abilities (e.g. [29]).

(b) Acquisition

   Based on the difference in the nature of trait storage in cultural and
   biological evolution, the acquisition of traits is also fundamentally
   different. Genetic traits are in place at the beginning of an
   individual’s life, whereas cultural traits are acquired throughout the
--
   social learning to acquire the fundamental behaviours and techniques
   but they also rely on lifelong improvement through individual learning
   [50]. This difference between cultural and biological evolution has
   received rather limited attention, but it may be one of the most
   important ones influencing evolutionary dynamics [51,52]. As we will
   discuss below, the fact that humans are born without culture and
   acquire culture sequentially, making the individual an active force in
   the transmission, has several consequences for the dynamics of cultural
   evolution, including, for instance, the fact that previously acquired
   traits can facilitate or even preclude the subsequent acquisition of
   other traits, and that an individual may transmit different trait
--
   alterations to the environment), such that the observer can form its
   own mental representation of a cultural trait. This difference between
   cultural and biological evolution is widely recognized [15,17,24] and
   consistent with general findings in developmental psychology and
   educational science (e.g. [48,49]). Nevertheless, the concrete
   transmission process and its consequences for the evolutionary dynamics
   are not fully understood and are subject to an ongoing debate (see
   §3b). At its centre is the role of the relative fidelity of
--
   Given that mental representations of cultural traits are transmitted
   through observation and recreation, there is no fixed transmission
   direction. Compared to biological evolution, where genes are
   transmitted from parents to offspring, transmission in cultural
   evolution can occur between any individuals. The diversity of possible
   transmission pathways, which in themselves are subject to cultural
   evolution, leads to interesting complex patterns [62].

(iii) Receiver dependence

   Another interesting and increasingly recognized difference of
   transmission in biological and cultural evolution is that genetic
   traits are supplied all at once, without the participation of the new
   individual. By contrast, in the transmission of cultural traits, not
   only the sender (teacher, model or demonstrator) but also the receiver
   (student or observer) can actively affect the transmission dynamics and
   thus evolutionary dynamics [16,17]. For instance, the observer may be
   selective about what and from whom to learn [16,17,63]. Such biases or
   social learning strategies [64,65] may be inborn [16,17] or stem from
--

   Sorting processes are processes that lead to a non-random change in the
   frequency of traits. In biological evolution, the main sorting process
   is natural selection. How it operates is usually clear and well
   understood, and it brings a general understanding of biological
   adaptations. In cultural evolution, the situation is considerably more
   complex, which is in part due to the active role each individual takes
   in acquiring, exhibiting and transmitting cultural traits [17]. The
--
   control by, for instance, trying to influence what others do, or
   communicate by selectively punishing or rewarding such acts [68–70]. In
   addition, there is natural selection in cultural evolution, since
   cultural traits can influence survival and reproduction of their
   carriers and so affect trait frequencies [15,17]. For instance, a habit
--

   In summary, sorting is possibly the most complex part of the
   evolutionary dynamics of cultural evolution, as it involves a number of
   different processes, and several of these occur in combination with
   other key processes such as transmission and generation of new culture.
--

   The continuous generation of variation is a central aspect of
   evolution. A generally recognized difference between biological and
   cultural evolution is that genetic variation is random and unrelated to
   any need or purpose. By contrast, in cultural evolution the generation
   of new variants can also be incentive-driven. This means that it is
   directed towards solving a concrete problem or reaching a certain goal.

   used.

3.  Implications and challenges for cultural evolution theory

   The differences that we discussed in the previous section can have
   dramatic effects on the evolutionary dynamics. In this part, we will
   discuss a selection of these that we think are particularly important
   to the further development of cultural evolution theory.

(a) Potential for fast evolution and complex culture

   Cultural evolution can proceed much faster than biological evolution,
   both in rate of change and in terms of trait complexity. This has been
   pointed out previously, and several reasons are generally given for why
--
   throughout an individual’s entire lifetime. Secondly, novel or modified
   traits can be transmitted directly to other individuals (which is why
   cultural evolution is sometimes described as Lamarckian rather than
   Darwinian). Thirdly, the generation of novel variants can be
   incentive-driven. This may have a dramatic effect on the rate of
   evolution, since cultural traits will be much more likely to be
   productive once they ‘enter’ the real world. And, finally, language can
   be an important tool for efficient cultural transmission. It is
--
   mental skills.

   A full understanding of evolutionary rates and complex culture also
   requires a detailed understanding of cumulative cultural evolution.
   Cumulative culture is not only the accumulation of traits but also the
   innovation of new traits by combining or recombining existing traits
--
   theory of how cultural complexity and cultural systems emerge (see
   §3d). Also, it could explain, through the power of combinatorics, how
   cultural evolution can generate a never-ending stream of new variation.

   For a better understanding of the role of language and recombination in
   cumulative cultural evolution, future research needs to address several
   important questions, such as:
     * i.
       What are the combinatorial properties that allow a seemingly
       unbounded generation of diversity and complexity in human
       cumulative cultural evolution?
     * ii.
       What is the role of language, symbolism, and cognitive abilities in
       cumulative cultural evolution?
     * iii.
       Can all types of cultural change be understood in evolutionary
       terms (listed in table 1), or do we need additional theoretical
       frameworks?
--

   Development here refers broadly to the processes that shape and modify
   the individual during its lifetime. In biological evolution,
   development is usually separated from the processes that transmit
   genetic traits and its evolution is studied in life-history theory,
   which emphasizes the role of trade-offs [81]. By contrast, in cultural
   evolution, development and transmission processes tend to be more
   intertwined, as they occur on the same time scale. On the one hand, an
   individual’s experience is shaped by sequential encounters with its
--
   psychology, educational science and linguistics [48,49]. Several
   general findings from empirical research in these fields are relevant
   to cultural evolution. First and foremost, development is generally
   incremental and time-consuming, starting with learning simple features
   and elements that are later integrated into a functional practical or
--
   individuals. The situation is complicated by findings showing that
   learning and memory abilities themselves respond to training, and are
   thus partly cultural and subject to cultural evolution [48,89,90].

   Previous theoretical models of cultural evolution typically use
   simplified assumptions about individual development and rely on simple
   copying mechanisms and strategies for social learning [91–94], or treat
   social and individual learning as opposing alternatives [17,95], whose
   evolution is generally studied in the absence of a
   learning–reproduction trade-off (see [96] for how classical results are
   critically changed once the learning–reproduction trade-off is taken
--
   of simpler traits or because they require individual improvement).
   These models should further be embedded into a proper life-history
   context so as to make all traits pertaining to learning co-evolutionary
   [97].

--
     * i.
       How can developmental psychology and related fields inform cultural
       evolution research? For example, in the debate between the
       ‘California’ and the ‘Paris’ school on why cultural learning can be
       faithful to its source and maintained over generations, while
--
       feedback loops.
     * ii.
       What is the scope of cultural evolution in terms of mental
       abilities? To what extent are mental abilities and psychological
       mechanisms learnt from or influenced by the cultural environment
       [100,101], and thus subject to cultural evolution themselves [30]?
       Future models that combine developmental processes and cultural
       evolution may help to distinguish the roles of inborn factors,
       acquired traits and individual experience.
     * iii.
--
       co-evolved with life history?

(c) Different evolutionary outcomes and cultural fitness

   In biological evolution, the fate of a trait can be understood by
   considering the average reproductive success of all carriers of that
   trait [102,103]. It is common to use optimization and game theoretic
   approaches to study evolutionary endpoints (i.e. adaptations). By
   contrast, in cultural evolution there is no generally accepted
   formulation of cultural fitness [104] as the relationship between the
   individual and its traits is more complicated. Here, transmission is
--
   individuals, and the individual is not fixed with respect to the
   cultural traits it possesses and exhibits to others during its life.
   These differences have implications both for the outcome of evolution
   and for how cultural evolution should be theoretically explored
   [11,15,17,52]. In principle, anything that influences transmission,
   retention and use of cultural traits needs to be considered.

   frequency compared to A. Figure 1 provides a numerical example. A
   complete analysis of cultural evolution scenarios of this kind requires
   exploration of both the evolution of lifestyles and the evolution of
   preferences for lifestyles [108].

   fertility could spread in cultural evolution (see §3c).

   In any human society, we find a range of both material and non-material
--

   It is quite possible that concepts like adaptation and fitness in
   cultural evolution will not have equivalent and as straightforward
   meanings as they do in biological evolution. The complication is that
   individuals are subject to change during their lives, which can be
   illustrated by comparing a trait that transmits rather slowly to
--
   on just the traits or free-floating memes [104]. While this can be a
   useful approach for certain questions, a general theory of cultural
   evolution cannot ignore the individual because of its active roll in
   acquiring, processing and exhibiting cultural traits [104]. This is one
   of the reasons that make it so tricky to find a useful concept of units
   of evolution in cultural evolution (a unit might be the single cultural
   trait or a set of traits, but also the carrier of a trait, etc.).

       observed diversity of outcomes of human cultural evolution?
     * ii.
       How can we define and recognize cultural adaptations, at what level
       are they manifested, and how can we use them to identify useful
       units of cultural evolution?
     * iii.
       What could be a useful concept of fitness in cultural evolution,
       and, if it exists, how can it be used to study cultural evolution?

(d) Trait interactions, cultural systems and evolving evolutionary dynamics

   The facts that individuals acquire traits sequentially and that traits
   can interact may have important organizing effects. The resulting
   developmental path dependence (see §3b) can limit which traits an
   individual acquires, and so promote the evolution of cultural systems
   [22,55,66,111,112]. For instance, an individual might acquire a belief
   A about the world, which subsequently facilitates the acquisition of
--
   acquisition of an entirely different belief system. Similar reasoning
   can apply to other categories of traits. In fact, there are many ways
   in which traits can interact and influence evolution. Traits may or may
   not operate well together (within or between individuals), they might
   express preferences towards other traits, and define goals the
--

   Trait interactions could also have even more pronounced effects, and
   bring about changes to the evolutionary process itself, that is,
   important aspects of cultural evolution dynamics may themselves be
   results of cultural evolution rather than determined by genetic factors
   or external circumstances [22,114,115]. Examples of such changes in
   biological evolution are migration, mutation and sexual reproduction,
   which are called modifier traits. These traits have important
   consequences for the dynamics of biological evolution, but they are
   also products of that same evolution, thus resulting in
   counterintuitive feedbacks [116]. All items in table 1 are potentially
   subject to cultural evolution, and it has been suggested that cultural
   evolution itself can influence social learning abilities [1], efforts
   by senders’ and receivers’ willingness to change [114,117], and
   transmission pathways [62]. Culturally established goals could have a
   dramatic effect on the outcome of cultural evolution. Acerbi et al.
   [114] introduced the term regulatory traits for cultural traits that
   influence the dynamics of the evolutionary process and suggested that
   their evolution depends on their ability to directly or indirectly
   influence their own evolution.

   The organizing effects of interactions and feedbacks can also be seen
   in the broader perspective of evolutionary transitions. These are
   fundamental modifications to the evolutionary process, caused by
   evolution itself. Maynard Smith &amp; Szathmáry [21] recognized several
   properties common to such transitions, which we can also find in human
   cultural evolution. The first property is that new ways of transmitting
   information are formed. Humans have invented a series of information
   technologies, like reading and writing, radio and television, databases

4.  Concluding remarks

   Studying cultural evolution in an evolutionary framework has come a
   long way. The development of this research programme has proven
   invaluable to our understanding of many cultural phenomena. The many
   differences between cultural and biological evolution, while not
   invalidating an evolutionary approach, show that there is a rich
   research field with many potentially interesting avenues for future
   studies. The way mental representations are stored, recalled,
--

   We hope that the collection of ideas we have presented here have
   highlighted some of the complexity of cultural evolution, which occurs
   at different organizational levels, along different timelines, between
   the material and the immaterial, and the biotic and abiotic world.
   Clearly, a full understanding of culture requires interdisciplinary
   efforts. Fortunately, cultural evolution research has always been at
   home in a variety of disciplines. And on closer inspection, much work
   has been evolutionary at its core, even if the term was not explicitly
   used.

   Acknowledgements) have emphasized the value of overcoming semantic
   barriers that exist across disciplines. Despite different historical
   motivations, perspectives and approaches to cultural evolution
   research, there are shared ambitions and overlapping questions. We
   would like to close this essay with three suggestions to strengthen the
--
   segregation, social immobility, systems of belief, cooperation, trust
   and polarization. There has been a tendency to focus on general
   questions in cultural evolution modelling, such as the emergence,
   change, transmission and accumulation of cultural traits. By
   considering more specific phenomena, it should also be possible to
   generate new concrete and testable hypotheses. Perhaps one of the best
   examples of a productive interaction between cultural evolutionary
   theorising and empirical research, blending general and specific
   theories with in-depth knowledge about the phenomena, can be found in
   recent developments in language evolution [121].

   Acknowledging existing work in other fields. We also think that it is
--
   the humanities and the social sciences, and also to make use of the
   wealth of existing empirical data on human culture. There are two
   aspects to this. One is that evolutionary thinking is not a novel
   concept in the humanities and social sciences, as we discussed above.
   The other is that many theories, including verbal, statistical and
   mathematical models, are genuinely evolutionary in our sense, without
   using the term evolution. Thus there are clear overlapping goals with
   cultural evolutionary research. This applies to both older verbal
   hypotheses and recent theoretical work. A few examples of the latter
   include: studies on social learning dynamics in evolutionary game
   theory in economics [122,123]; the dynamics of knowledge production and
   acquisition at the aggregate (population) level studied in
   macroeconomics [124–127]; and models of beliefs of agents studied in
   sociology [128,129]. Microeconomics has also adopted the cultural
   evolution framework, as introduced by Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, and
   applies it to all sorts of questions [130,131]. An important next step
   in acknowledging existing research must be synthetic work. It has
--
   Connecting disciplines. Finally, we suggest making use of knowledge
   from and cooperation with a few fields that are rarely mentioned in
   formal theoretical studies of cultural evolution. Two such fields that
   we have mentioned throughout this paper are developmental psychology
   and educational science. Together these fields have gathered important
--
   scenarios described, and the interaction with individual learning,
   differ from assumptions and strategic thinking about social learning
   common in cultural evolution research. They also offer insight into
   nature–nurture issues, the scope of cultural evolution, and how mental
   abilities can be transmitted. Another field of potential interest is
   artificial intelligence and related fields in cognitive science, which

   changes in the selective environments of organisms across the tree of
   life. Our collective understanding about biological evolution can help
   identify and mitigate many of the environmental problems in the
   Anthropocene. To this end, we propose a stronger integration of
   environmental sciences with evolutionary biology.

   All ecosystems, be they natural or engineered, contain biological
   organisms that are bound by the principles of biological evolution. As
   such, biological evolution is often a central feature of many problems
   that are currently being tackled by environmental scientists. Yet
   fundamental principles from the discipline of evolutionary biology are
   rarely used in the analysis and mitigation of environmental problems,
   even when evolutionary processes are closely linked to their
   manifestation (Carroll et al., 2014; Jørgensen et al., 2019).
   Environmental scientists are particularly adept at reaching across
   disciplines to ensure that they have the knowledge and tools necessary
   to tackle complex environmental problems. Here we propose that a wider
   application of principles of evolutionary biology would help us achieve
   more sustainable solutions to environmental problems.

   In brief, evolution is a process of heritable change in the phenotype
   of a population of organisms (Box 1). While evolution can result from
   random genetic drift (representing “neutral” evolution), here we focus
   on adaptive evolution, defined as a change in population mean fitness
   in response to natural selection (Box 1). Genetic and trait variation,
   and how such variation changes over time and space, are fundamental
   properties of living systems. There is mounting evidence that evolution
   is sufficiently fast in natural populations to be highly relevant for
   understanding how populations will respond to human-mediated

   Applying evolutionary principles to understand environmental problems
   is not a novel idea (Gunderson and Holling, 2002, Santamaria and
   Mendez, 2012), but widespread application is still limited (Jørgensen
   et al., 2019). In the context of the biodiversity crisis ecologists are
   increasingly using evolutionary theory to help mitigate the loss of
   genetic and species diversity due to climate change and environmental
   pollution (Bell and Gonzalez, 2009; Kristensen et al., 2018).
   evolutionary theory is also critical to understanding the emergence of
   antibiotic resistance in microbes (Palmer and Kishony, 2013) and
   chemical resistance in pests (Fisher et al., 2018). Plainly,
   evolutionary theory can be highly relevant to pertinent environmental
   problems, but it is not broadly applied. There is a frequent use of
   methods and technologies originating from evolutionary biology. In
   particular, molecular genetic methods are often used to characterise
   microbial community composition (Das and Dash, 2019), and the patterns
--
   al., 2017). While such methods are undeniably useful to gain functional
   insights, they are rarely used in environmental science to study
   evolutionary processes. The potential for evolutionary applications in
   environmental sciences is far reaching, and in the next sections we
   focus on core concepts of evolution and exemplify how they can be
   applied to a range of environmental problems in aquatic ecosystems.

1.1. The structure of evolutionary processes

   The structure and rate of change of heritable trait variation in living
--
   by genes (so called genotype-phenotype maps; (Houle et al., 2010)).
   Individuals interact within populations, where average trait values
   change through evolutionary and environmental processes (Burns, 1992;
   Frank, 2011; Pedersen and Tuomi, 1995), and populations interact and
   evolve within multi-species communities (Weber et al., 2017). As a
--
   contribute to maladaptation of natural populations and thereby can
   potentially hinder conservation efforts (Leitwein et al., 2019).
   Despite the long held view that evolution is a slow process, it is now
   well established that the pace of heritable trait change can be
   sufficiently fast to affect population dynamics, species interactions,
   and ecosystem processes - i.e. evolution can act at ecological time
   scales (Hairston et al., 2005; Stockwell et al., 2003). The dynamics of
   species interactions in natural communities are hence not simply a
   product of past evolution. Rather, evolutionary processes can shape
   trait distributions of populations (i.e. mean and variance) at a pace
   that is highly relevant for many environmental problems.

   evolutionary processes can either ameliorate or exacerbate
   environmental problems. evolutionary adaptation, for example, can drive
   the recovery of populations, or even multi-species communities, from
   decline, in a process known as “evolutionary rescue” (Bell and
   Gonzalez, 2009; Low-Décarie et al., 2015). In natural populations,
   evolution has rescued killifish from chemical pollution (Whitehead et
   al., 2017) and amphibians from acidification (Hangartner et al., 2012).
   In these cases, genetic adaptation has allowed for the persistence of
   populations in environments that would otherwise be unsuitable.
   evolutionary novelty can also emerge in populations exposed to
   synthetic environments created by humans, and, in doing so, perform
   essential evosystem services (Rudman et al., 2017). For example, the
--
   in Germany (Kahl et al., 2018), possibly associated with a microbial
   consortium of proteobacterial species (Fig. 1 ). Identifying the
   evolutionary processes governing such bioremediation dynamics could
   help address the persistence of chemicals in our natural environments
   for which engineering solutions are lacking. On the other hand,
   evolutionary processes can also create novel environmental problems, or
   worsen existing ones. For example, the emergence and amplification of
   antibiotic resistance genes is a global problem, caused by the
   widespread overuse of antibiotics (Palmer and Kishony, 2013). In
   wastewater treatment plants, the concentration of antibiotic resistance
   genes may be amplified by evolution prior to water discharge into
   natural aquatic environments (Ju et al., 2019) (Fig. 1). Understanding
   and monitoring the evolutionary process in wastewater treatment plants
   could improve our ability to limit the release of antibiotic resistance
   genes into natural environments (Czekalski et al., 2015).

   treatment plant (WWTP) can either cause a beneficial reduction in a
   pollutant concentration (ACE: the artificial sweetener Acesulfame) due
   to the evolution of catabolism of novel/synthetic compounds, or an
   unwanted increase in resistance genes in a microbial population due to
   positive selection in the treatment plant (Figure design by Peter
--

   In this section, we illustrate how a broader application of
   evolutionary theory can enable environmental scientists to craft better
   solutions for environmental problems. To this end, we use four examples
   from aquatic systems: (i) emergence and epidemiology of disease, (ii)
--
   outbreaks of algal blooms.

2.1. Disease dynamics in natural populations: when evolution kills or cures

   Diseases are among the most severe environmental problems. They are a
--
   (Engering et al., 2013; Longdon et al., 2014). Most disease-causing
   organisms have large populations and short generation times, which
   generally facilitates rapid evolution. Consequently, disease emergence
   typically involves rapid co-evolutionary dynamics that stem from
   natural selection on both pathogen infectivity and host defense
   (Penczykowski et al., 2016). Rapid evolutionary dynamics are expected
   to take place at the onset of disease emergence, governed by the
   pathogens' and the hosts' evolutionary history.

   Disease emergence is often a consequence of human activities. Transport
   between continents can bring pathogens into naïve host populations that
   are, at least initially, defenseless; they can lack sufficient genetic
   variation for resistance because they do not have coevolutionary
   history with these pathogens. The crayfish plague provides a good
   example. Aphanomyces astaci, a pathogen of freshwater crayfish native
   to North America came to Europe with introduced American crayfish
   (Svoboda et al., 2017). American crayfish species had evolved a high
   tolerance of the pathogen, due to their long evolutionary history, but
   the pathogen proved devastating to stocks of European freshwater
   crayfish species (Holdich et al., 2009). Likewise, human activities
--
   locally highly virulent pathogens (Stukenbrock and McDonald, 2008). For
   example, large monocultures of genetically homogenous plants can
   facilitate the evolution of host specialization (McDonald and
   Stukenbrock, 2016), leading to evolutionary dynamics that are not
   commonly observed in natural ecosystems.

   evolutionary theory can be instrumental in helping to understand the
   origin and spread of diseases through populations. Increasingly,
   researchers can track disease dynamics over time by comparing genetic
--
   bacterial and fungal diseases, but in some cases a single new drug can
   cause strong natural selection, and, combined with the high
   evolutionary potential of pathogens, this means that the expected time
   until drug resistance evolves can be short (Fisher et al., 2018;
   Kennedy and Read, 2018). For such scenarios, we need to develop
   evolution-aware strategies to avoid and control emergent diseases. For
   example, in the case of chemical treatments, combination therapy or the
   sequential application of different drugs can delay resistance
   evolution (Palmer and Kishony, 2013; Roemhild et al., 2018), and the
   development of ‘evolution-proof’ drugs is a particularly attractive
   idea (Bell and MacLean, 2018). Alternative strategies include fighting
   the disease with agents that are able to evolve themselves, such as
--
   (Kueneman et al., 2016).

2.2. Renewable biofuels: when evolution fills our tanks

   The dwindling supply and the negative environmental impact of fossil
--
   The ideal species for maximum production would be unconstrained by the
   trade-offs inherent to all living systems. Yet such omnipotent
   organisms, known in evolutionary biology as Darwinian demons (Krakauer,
   2011; Law, 1979), do not exist and cannot be engineered. Nevertheless,
   sustainable yield of biofuels could be optimized by understanding the
--
   confer resistance to parasites, and are resistant to grazers (Shurin et
   al., 2013, Shurin et al., 2016; T. Yoshida et al., 2004). Understanding
   the evolution of ecologically relevant traits, under different biotic
   and abiotic contexts, may improve the stability and efficiency of
   biofuel production.

   The application of evolutionary theory to algal biofuel production is
   in its infancy, but holds immense potential. Algal populations are
   large and have short generation times. Usually the populations maintain
   high phenotypic and genetic diversity (Brandenburg et al., 2018; Chen
   and Rynearson, 2016; Lebret et al., 2012; Masseret et al., 2009;
   Rynearson and Armbrust, 2000). evolution in such populations can be
   fast if selection is strong (Thibodeau et al., 2015; Takehito Yoshida
   et al., 2003). Harnessing the adaptive evolutionary potential of algal
   populations could help us explore the range of feasible trait space to
   obtain desirable trait combinations. For example, researchers are
--
   population growth rates. Such trait combinations are normally mutually
   exclusive. Approaches include genetic engineering (Zeng et al., 2011),
   directed evolution via successive rounds of mutagenesis and selection
   (Johnson et al., 2016; Lewin et al., 2016), and selection on the
   existing levels of genetic variation in a population (Mooij et al.,
   2013; Shurin et al., 2016).

   While evolution might help us improve biofuel production (Kazamia et
   al., 2014), it might also culminate in undesirable outcomes. For
   example, engineering solutions based on evolutionary trade-offs might
   be eroded over time due to mutation, horizontal gene transfer, and
   recombination. Custom designed biofuel production systems should also
   consider the evolutionary consequences of rapid harvesting. For
   example, rare beneficial mutations arising during population expansion,
   might be periodically lost before they sweep to dominance in the
   populations (Bull and Collins, 2012; Shurin et al., 2016). In short,
   evolution offers both promises and pitfalls for biofuel production.

2.3. Chemical pollutants: when evolution is, and is not, the solution to
pollution

--
   Because pollution and the ecological context in which pollution occurs
   is often highly local, we can expect pollution to have many different
   evolutionary consequences in natural ecosystems. However, the
   biological effects of pollutants are typically studied using a limited
   number of model species and strains, usually in oversimplified
--
   organisms (Relyea and Hoverman, 2006). Synthetic chemicals present a
   particular challenge because the exposed organisms may lack the
   exposure history necessary for the emergence of an evolutionary
   adaptation. Synthetic chemicals can also act as mutagens that disrupt
   the homeostasis of organisms (Bickham et al., 2000).
--
   that their persistence over time becomes threatened (Williams and
   Oleksiak, 2008). Interestingly many classic studies about rapid
   evolution involve chemical pollution, such as the evolution of
   resistance to pesticides, resistance to antibiotics or mining-related
   metal pollution (Hoffmann and Parsons, 1997; Palumbi, 2009) and, more
   recently, pollutant induced elevated mutation rates and rapid
   adaptation (Brady et al., 2017; Coutellec and Barata, 2013; Kimberly
   and Salice, 2012; Loria et al., 2019; Palumbi, 2009). evolutionary
   adaptation to chemical pollution can also rescue populations from
   extinction caused by demographic decline. For example, experimental
--
   genetic adaptations (Oziolor et al., 2017; Reid et al., 2016).
   Unsurprisingly, adaptation of a population can also be an unwanted
   outcome of management, such as when the evolution of resistance reduces
   the sensitivity of a species used in ecological risk assessment (Morgan
   et al., 2007). evolution's ability to alter the direction of responses
   to environmental change, such as that brought by chemical pollution, is
   one of the main arguments for including evolutionary concepts in
   environmental research. Finally, potential for evolutionarily based
   solutions to pollution comes from implementing bioremediation, such as
   designing microbial communities that have evolved the ability of
   biodegradation of chemicals (Liu and Suflita, 1993).

2.4. Algal blooms: when evolution muddies the waters

   Harmful algal blooms are often associated with eutrophication,
--
   input releases phytoplankton from control by grazers (Abrams and
   Walters, 1996; Gragnani et al., 1999; Pančić and Kiørboe, 2018).
   Additionally, evolutionary processes are also relevant to the
   emergence, volume and toxicity of blooms. Indeed, we postulate that
   trying to manage harmful blooms without Darwin, is like trying to fly
   to the moon without Newton (modifying Andrew Read's concluding remark
   on his TEDMED talk on importance of evolutionary medicine:
   https://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=7286).

   The trade-off between resource uptake and grazing resistance is at the
   root of the ecological and evolutionary causes of bloom biomass
   (Cloern, 2018). Selective grazing by zooplankton will deplete edible
   algae and, subsequently, increase the abundance of well-defended algae
--
   varies widely both within and among populations. For example, some
   lineages entirely lack the genes for toxin production (Brandenburg et
   al., 2018; Briand et al., 2009). The evolutionary dynamics of different
   toxic/non-toxic genotypes during algal blooms is likely driven by
   physiological trade-offs between costs of toxin production and resource
--
   et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012), but the selective factors that favor
   toxic variants in bloom forming algae are not fully understood.
   Identifying the evolutionary processes involved in algal blooms would
   likely help us predict which algal blooms might turn toxic. In a first
   step, reliable prediction would enable the avoidance of risks
--
3. Evolving the environmental sciences

   evolutionary processes are often an inescapable and critical component
   of both understanding and solving environmental problems. The evolution
   of resistance genes will continually challenge our efforts to halt
   diseases through the development of new drugs, highlighting the need to
   complement efforts in drug discovery with the development of
   evolution-aware application strategies. A better appreciation of
   evolution's limits and, in particular, the impossibility of Darwinian
   demons, is critical to meeting our energy demands by matching algal
   genotypes with optimal environmental conditions for biofuel production.
--
   conservative option when assessing ecological risk to chemical
   pollutants. Engineering solutions in waste-water treatment plants might
   be improved if we could harness evolution's power to help biodegrade
   persistent compounds (Brenner et al., 2008). Other environmental
   problems with limited engineering-oriented solutions could be tackled
   with evolutionary perspectives. For example, biocides may be applied to
   combat algal blooms, but it is notoriously difficult to predict the
   timing, duration and toxicity of algal blooms. A better understanding
   of the evolutionary dynamics of such systems, gained, for example, by
   tracking environmental change in real-time and linking those changes
   with environmental sources of natural selection, could help us predict
--
   also sensitive to anthropogenic impacts. Predictions about complex
   ecological systems are challenging and require solid understanding of
   ecological and evolutionary mechanisms behind population growth,
   genetic and trait diversity, trait-environmental relationships,
   trade-offs, and community dynamics. Such principles are present in the
--

   It is possible that prevailing misconceptions about the pace and
   prevalence of evolution may be blocking the integration of evolution
   into the environmental sciences. First, the pace of evolutionary
   adaptation is not only set by the rate of mutations and the subsequent
   rate of increase of novel alleles in the population. Instead, the rate
   of adaptation, i.e. the increase in mean population fitness over time,
   is directly proportional to the genetic variance in a population that
   can respond to natural selection (Fisher, 1930). evolution from
   existing levels of heritable trait variation in a population can be
   much quicker and more predictable than expected based on evolution
   driven via new variants in the population that arise solely by
   mutation. Second, evolution is neither rare nor a special case. The
   challenge for environmental science is to determine the relative
   importance of evolution, either for causing or for ameliorating a
   particular environmental problem.

   Overall, we argue that evolutionary principles are a useful resource
   for coming up with solutions to environmental problems. On the one
   hand, seemingly rational solutions might require some ‘evolution
   proofing’ to effectively anticipate and limit any potential negative
   impacts of evolution on the expected outcomes of our interventions. On
   the other hand, evolution itself can be a powerful design strategy for
   solving environmental problems. Design by directed evolution, for
   example, has made considerable progress developing novel enzymes
   (Arnold, 1998), and configuring communities to perform specific
--
   way forward is to relinquish our engineering hubris in favor of a
   problem solving strategy that is either informed by, or directed by,
   evolution. Environmental science has a rich history of
   interdisciplinarity. A stronger integration with evolutionary biology
   would improve our ability to address global societal challenges in
   general (Carroll et al., 2014), and environmental challenges in

Background

   Although personal, familial, and community conflict with evolution have
   been documented in the literature, these scales require
   conceptualization as a construct and operationalization as a measure.
   The Scales of Conflict with evolution Measure (SECM) instrument was
   developed in response to these needs. Using a construct validity
   framework, the content, internal structure, convergent, and substantive
--
   Equation Modeling (SEM), and follow up questioning. The conceptual
   utility of the instrument was explored by examining whether it added
   explanatory insights into evolution acceptance above and beyond
   religiosity, evolution knowledge, and background variables.

Results

   A literature review and expert consultation indicated that construct
   of evolutionary conflict perception should (i) encompass the
   hierarchical nature of human social structures (personal, family,
   community) and (ii) probe conflict as it relates to human values,
--
   operationalized as a nine-item rating scale measure. Using Rasch
   analyses of SECM responses from a diverse sample of >gt; 1000 students
   studying evolution, the instrument met criteria of robust measurement,
   including: fit to model expectations; three-dimensional structure; high
   reliability; good rating scale function; measurement invariance with
--
   personal conflict, with family showing a stronger and modest impact,
   and (ii) personal conflict had a significant and modest causal impact
   on evolution acceptance above and beyond the contributions of
   religiosity, evolution knowledge, and background variables.

Conclusion

   The SECM is an easy-to-administer instrument to measure conflict with
   evolution and is supported by several forms of validity evidence. The
   SECM has potential for facilitating measurement of
   evolutionary conflict in educational settings, thereby raising
   instructor awareness of conflict levels in students, promoting rigorous
   evaluations of educational interventions designed to reduce conflict,
   and fostering conceptual advances in the field of evolution education.
   Future work is needed to gather additional forms of validity evidence
   and to test current validity claims in additional participant samples.
   SECM measures should also be incorporated into more complex SEM models
   that treat evolution knowledge and religiosity as part of the
   structural paths to evolution acceptance. Such models could provide
   insights into the most worthwhile targets for the development of
   educational interventions to mitigate conflict at multiple scales.

   The idea that individuals may harbor feelings of conflict with
   evolutionary principles, and that such conflict may be linked to their
   acceptance of evolution, has been discussed in the literature for
   decades (e.g., Clough 1994; Dagher and BouJaoude 1997; Graves 2019;
   Nehm et al. 2009; Scharmann and Harris 1992; Turner 1978). Many
   qualitative studies (and a few quantitative ones) confirm that feelings
   of conflict are an important variable to consider in the complex web of
   factors accounting for evolution acceptance (e.g., Barnes et al. 2020;
   Clough 1994; Ha et al. 2012; Konnemann et al. 2018; Nehm et al. 2009;
   Scharmann and Harris 1992). Conflict with evolution may be
   characterized in many ways: by its presence (i.e., yes, no), magnitude
   (high, low), sources (e.g., religion, societal implications), scales
--
   Konnemann et al. 2018; Mead et al. 2015; Nehm et al. 2009; Rissler et
   al. 2014; Scharmann and Harris 1992). Despite widespread recognition of
   its importance for evolution education research and practice, only a
   few studies in evolution education have empirically quantified conflict
   (e.g., Barnes et al. 2020; Konnemann et al. 2018; Nehm and Schonfeld
   2007), which is undoubtedly related to the paucity of
   easy-to-administer assessment tools for this topic (cf. Nehm and Mead
   2019). Developing robust measures of conflict with evolutionary ideas
   could: facilitate more frequent measurement in educational settings,
   raise instructor awareness of conflict levels in students, and foster
--
   conflict (e.g., Ha et al. 2015; Nehm et al. 2009; Scharmann and Harris
   1992). Such a measure could also lead to conceptual advances in the
   field of evolution education, as discussed below.

   First, feelings of conflict may impact evolution acceptance in ways
   that have not been precisely accounted for in prior work. For example,
   religiosity and evolution knowledge are commonly explored contributors
   to evolution acceptance (Mead et al. 2015; e.g., Bailey et al. 2011;
   Barone et al. 2014; Dagher and BouJaoude 1997; Deniz et al. 2008; Dunk
   et al. 2017; Glaze et al. 2014; Heddy and Nadelson 2013; Lombrozo et
--
   (e.g., Barnes and Brownell 2017; Glaze et al. 2014; Rissler et al.
   2014). However, while it has been shown that individuals may be
   conflicted about evolution because of their religious beliefs and
   cultures, they may also be conflicted for many other reasons (and
   religious respondents may not be conflicted at all). Nehm et al.
   (2009), for example, found that conflict with evolution had only a
   modest relationship with religiosity and was more strongly associated
   with degree of acceptance (Nehm et al. 2009). Additionally,
   cross-cultural studies in non-religious societies (e.g., China) have
   found only moderate levels of overall evolution acceptance (Ha et al.
   2019). Studies such as these indicate that the relationships between
   religiosity and acceptance require further scrutiny. This work also
   suggests that conflict with evolution has the potential to be important
   as (i) a mediator of the relationship between evolution acceptance and
   religiosity, and (ii) a unique explanatory factor of acceptance that
   encompasses a more expansive range of conflict measures beyond those
--

   Second, broadening the scope of conflict measurement (i.e., perceived
   family and community conflict with evolution in addition to personal
   conflict) could reveal contributors to personal conflict as well as
   their interrelationships. Prior work suggests that the attitudes
   perceived to be held by members of one’s social groups (e.g., family,
   friends, teachers, church members) impact personal conflict with–and
   acceptance of–evolution (e.g., Barnes et al. 2017b; Donnelly et al.
   2009; Hill 2014; Winslow et al. 2011). Affinity towards certain social
   groups (e.g., one’s community) could therefore be an important
   contributor to one’s personal conflict with evolution (e.g., personal
   level conflict). Individuals could have different causes of personal
   conflict (e.g., familial, community, religiosity, low evolution
   knowledge, combinations thereof), which could in turn contribute to
   different magnitudes of perceived conflict and evolution acceptance.
   Measuring perceptions of conflict at the family and community scale
   could therefore help to reveal important and measurable indirect causes
   of the observed differences in evolution acceptance that have been
   documented among demographic groups (see Bailey et al. 2011; Metzger et
   al. 2018; Sbeglia and Nehm 2018). In other words, it is possible that
--
   into an appropriate model, it would reveal their unique impacts on
   personal conflict, and could show that religiosity alone has a smaller
   relationship (direct or indirect) with evolution acceptance than is
   currently thought. Therefore, the SECM allows researchers to test if a
   respondent’s social relationships are additional important contributors
   (direct or indirect) to personal conflict and evolution acceptance.
   Overall, much more needs to be known about perceptions of personal,
   familial, and community conflict and their potential interactions with
--

   In summary, greater understanding of the scales of conflict with
   evolutionary ideas has potential for advancing conceptual understanding
   within the evolution education research community and for enhancing
   educational practices and outcomes relating to evolution (e.g.,
   reducing student conflict magnitudes). The Scale of evolutionary
   Conflict Measure (SECM) was developed as a first step towards advancing
   work in this area. Below we begin with a description of the conceptual
--
Conceptual framework: measurement

   evolution education researchers have approached the measurement of
   latent constructs (like conflict) from different conceptual and
   methodological perspectives (see Nehm and Mead 2019). Indeed, many
   types of reliability and validity evidence may be used to support
   claims about what evolution education instruments are able to measure
   (Campbell and Nehm 2013; Messick 1995). Validity and reliability
   evidence for the SECM was gathered in alignment with the Standards for
--
   robust measures of the desired latent construct (AERA et al. 2014). A
   latent construct is a feature that cannot be directly observed (e.g.,
   evolution acceptance, perceptions of conflict, religiosity). In order
   to generate robust measurement of a latent construct, specific
   characteristics of the underlying data must be present. These

   single topics or identities (e.g., those related to religion) given
   that too little is currently known about the diverse array of possible
   ways that conflict with evolution may manifest itself within
   respondents (Brem et al. 2003). We discuss the details of these core
   attributes below.
--
Scales of conflict: Personal, family, community

   An individual’s perception of conflict with evolution is likely to be
   situated within broader social contexts, and prior work suggests that
   the attitudes that are thought to be held by members of one’s social
   group (e.g., family, friends, teachers, church members) impact personal
   conflict with evolution (e.g., Barnes et al. 2017b; Donnelly et al.
   2009; Hill 2014; Winslow et al. 2011). Barnes et al. (2017b), for
   example, found that parental attitudes towards evolution were strongly
   associated with evolution acceptance. Likewise, Winslow et al. (2011)
   demonstrated that parents, and to a lesser extent church members, were
   strongly associated with personal views of evolution. Hill (2014) found
   that adolescent respondents who identified as religiously-devoted
   creationists were twice as likely to increase acceptance of evolution
   in early adulthood if they had friend networks in which not all members
   shared the respondent’s religious ideal type (religious ideal type is a
--
   2014). These studies suggest that the social groups to which
   individuals belong are related to personal conflict and overall
   acceptance of evolution.

   This prior work motivated the conceptualization of the construct
   ‘perception of evolutionary conflict’ at multiple, broadly defined
   social scales, namely: personal, family, and community. These three
   scales seek to capture the diversity of group memberships that a person

   perspectives, and engage in joint action in geographical locations or
   settings” (p. 1929). While the associations of family and community
   with perceptions of conflict and evolution acceptance have been
   advanced in the literature, researchers have yet to (i) develop
   measurement instruments that include such relationships or (ii)
--

   For each scale (personal, family, community), the perception of
   conflict with evolution was conceptualized as a construct that can be
   operationalized using several interrelated but distinct variables.
   Three variables from prior work (e.g., Barnes et al. 2017a, b; Brem et

   context and may be connected to broader aspects of identity. While
   relatively little work has focused on the non-religious aspects of
   beliefs, culture, and values as they relate to evolution acceptance
   (Brem et al. 2003 is an important exception), substantial work has been
   carried out on these elements (and their connections to identity) more
--
   1995; Southerland et al. 2001). Students hold beliefs about many
   topics, but religious beliefs in particular have been suggested to be
   strongly associated with perceptions of evolutionary conflict (Barnes
   et al. 2017a, 2017b; Rissler et al. 2014; Truong et al. 2018).
   Religious beliefs refer to the “specific beliefs one holds about the
   existence and influence of a deity” (Barnes and Brownell 2017, p. 3).
   Although evolution is often presented as incompatible with religious
   beliefs (e.g., Coyne 2015; Dawkins 2009), authors have shown that
   interventions designed to highlight their compatibility were associated
--
   assumptions about social complexity, spirituality, perceived fate
   control, cynicism, and rewards. A person’s culture may bear on
   perceptions of conflict with evolution if evolutionary theory is viewed
   as incompatible with shared assumptions or norms within their group,
   especially if a particular group enforces strict adherence to these
   norms. In particular, evolutionary ideas have been perceived to be at
   odds with one’s religious culture (defined as “the sociocultural norms
   that individuals experience related to religion.” [Barnes and Brownell

   the literal vs. non-literal interpretations of religious texts could
   explain the association between individuals’ perceptions of conflict
   with evolution and their specific religious affiliation (Dagher and
   BouJaoude 1997). Interventions designed to highlight the compatibility
   between evolutionary ideas and the perceptions of leaders of religious
   communities have been shown to be associated with an increase in
   acceptance (e.g., Manwaring et al. 2015). Other groups may also

   groups have been found to have lower levels of evolution acceptance
   than others (Bailey et al. 2011; Metzger et al. 2018; Sbeglia and Nehm
   2018). Unfortunately, few studies disaggregate evolution acceptance by
   race (Mead et al. 2015) and it is not currently known how the
   documented differences in acceptance relate to the magnitude or nature
   of perceived conflict with evolution. Nevertheless, although culture is
   known to be an important factor shaping perceptions, the assumption

   thought and action [idea of agency]”). These values are well-aligned
   with some of the negative perceived societal implications of
   evolutionary theory outlined and observed by Brem et al. (2003),
   including the naive perception that evolution implies a lack of control
   or self-determination and justifies selfishness and racial or ethnic
   discrimination. In one study, for example, the majority (56% and 65%,
   respectively) of college students reported that accepting evolutionary
   ideas makes it easier to justify racism and ethnic discrimination and
   harder to think of people as determining their own fate (Brem et al.
   2003). In summary, the literature supports the roles of beliefs,
   cultures, and values in the conceptualization of perceptions of
   conflict with evolution.

   university in the northeastern United States (N = 1179 for the pre-test
   [~ 90% participation rate]). All students were enrolled in introductory
   biology courses in which evolution was a major theme (nearly all units
   connected to evolution in some way). Participants were asked to self
   report background characteristics including age, gender, ethnicity or
   racial identity (White, Asian, or underrepresented minority [URM,
--
   and had representation from diverse backgrounds (in terms of race,
   ethnicity, and gender [see Table ​Table1]).1]). The sample was also
   chosen because evolution was a core idea in the courses, and
   accordingly was anticipated to spur thinking about evolution. In both
   semesters, the nature of science and evolution instruction occurred
   within the first few weeks of the semester. The pre-survey took place
   during the nature of science unit but before the evolution unit.

   A literature review as well as faculty experts from two fields

   closed-response items designed to capture perceptions of conflict at
   each scale between evolutionary ideas and (i) values, (ii) culture, and
   (iii) beliefs (n = 9 items total). Specifically, each of the nine items
   of the SECM had the following structure:

   We administered a survey to students at the beginning and end of the

   The survey included instruments that measure perceptions of evolution
   conflict (SECM), evolution acceptance (Inventory of Student evolution
   Acceptance [I-SEA], Nadelson and Southerland, 2012), evolution

I-SEA

   The I‐SEA measures evolution acceptance (Nadelson and Southerland
   2012). It contains three item sets (eight items each, 24 total), each
   representing a different evolutionary scale or taxon: microevolution,
   macroevolution, and human evolution. The scale and taxonomic
   differences among item sets may be considered surface features that are
   irrelevant to expert-like evolutionary reasoning (Nehm and Ha 2011).
   The items have a five‐option response format (strongly disagree [SD],
   disagree [D], undecided [U], agree [A], and strongly agree [SA]).
   Responses were coded from 0–4, with 4 representing the highest
   evolution acceptance. Items with negative valences were reverse-coded
   as appropriate. When necessary, adjacent categories were collapsed for
   those items in which one or more categories lacked responses. Existing

   To address RQ3, we correlated latent measures of each respondent’s

   perceived compatibility between respondents’ families and their
   evolutionary ideas.

RQ4: Does the SECM contribute to the explanation of evolution acceptance
above and beyond the contributions of religiosity and evolution knowledge?

   To address RQ4, we shifted our approach from a Rasch framework to a

   members of a particular group may align their perceptions and
   perspectives with those of the group (Kahan et al. 2007), which is a
   phenomenon that has been explicitly connected to evolution acceptance,
   evolution rejection, and science denial more broadly (Walker et al.
   2017^1). Furthermore, exposures to social groups during
   human development are thought to calibrate peoples' perceptual systems
--
   social identity (e.g., the ideas and perspectives held by the social
   group with which one identifies) may have a causal relationship with
   one’s personal perceptions of conflict with evolution. Other aspects of
   identity (e.g., one’s values, cultures, and beliefs) may be indicative
   of (i.e. manifestations of) one’s latent level of perceived conflict
   with evolution.

Description of the measurement model
--
   were modeled among items with parallel forms, and among items that
   focused on the same taxon. Taxon is a feature of instrument items that
   has been hypothesized to impact evolutionary reasoning and test
   performance (Kalinowski et al. 2016; Opfer et al. 2012). The I-SEA was
   modeled as three factors (microevolution, macroevolution, and human
   evolution) as recommended by the instrument’s authors (Nadelson and
   Southerland, 2012), and error covariances were modeled among items with
   negative valence, among items about human microevolution, and among
   items about human macroevolution, all of which have been hypothesized
   as possible additional dimensions within the instrument (see Sbeglia
   and Nehm 2019). Religiosity was modeled as one factor and error
--
   latent traits of family and community conflict perception were modeled
   as being causal to personal conflict perception, and personal conflict
   perception was modeled as causal to the three scales of evolution
   acceptance. Family and community conflict were allowed to covary and
   the three factors of evolution acceptance were allowed to covary.
   Background variables (i.e., plan, prior biology coursework, level, ELL
   status, reading and writing ability, gender, race), evolution
   knowledge, and religiosity were modeled as having structural paths to
   all factors within the model, which removes the linear effects of these
--
   With these controls in place, we estimated the significance of the
   causal paths among the scales of conflict, and between the personal
   conflict and the scales of evolution acceptance by generating
   asymptotic standard errors of parameter estimates using the Delta
   method (Rosseel 2020b). This analysis allowed the investigation of the
   unique contribution of the causal paths between the SECM and evolution
   acceptance, above and beyond religiosity and evolution knowledge (RQ3).

Fit statistics
--
   The mean of raw SECM scores was 1.99/6 (sd = 2.09) for personal
   conflict, 2.60/6 (sd = 2.42) for family conflict, and 2.51/6 (sd =
   2.16) for community conflict. The three faculty experts in evolution
   education and social psychology agreed that the items in the SECM were
   clearly worded and appropriately connected to and representative of the
   construct and the existing literature. The mean raw score of the I-SEA
   was 26.57/32 (sd = 4.5) for microevolution, 25.62/32 (sd = 4.24) for
   macroevolution, and 24.69/32 (sd = 5.52) for human evolution. The mean
   raw score for the CANS was 10.69/24 (sd = 4.68), and religiosity was
   15.97/36 (sd = 10.18). Below we answer each of our research questions

RQ1: Does the SECM adhere to well-accepted criteria of robust measurement?

   We used responses on the SECM to model evolutionary conflict perception
   as a one-dimensional and as a three-dimensional construct (i.e., a
   separate construct for personal conflict, family conflict, and

   thresholds for all items within each scale were generally well-spaced
   at the higher end of the trait (i.e., at intermediate and high levels
   of the perception of conflict with evolution), producing only small
   gaps in measurement (see thresholds 2–4). However, the thresholds at
   the lower end of the trait (i.e., at low levels of perceived conflict
   with evolution) had larger gaps among them, likely resulting in less
   precise measurement (see thresholds 1–2). Although the precision with
   which respondents could be clustered into bins at the lower end of the

   We found no evidence of DIF across time for any scale of
   evolutionary conflict in the SECM (t-ratio <lt; 2 for all interactions
   between items and time), suggesting measurement invariance for time in
   our sample. Therefore, the SECM appeared to measure the same construct

   There was a significant positive correlation between the latent
   measures of each respondent’s perception of their family’s conflict
   with evolution ideas (i.e., SECM Family item set) and the modified

   p <lt; 0.001).

RQ4: Do measures of conflict derived from the SECM contribute to the
explanation of evolution acceptance above and beyond the contributions of
religiosity and evolution knowledge?

   We used SEM (specifically LVPM) to evaluate the hypothesized causal
   relationships among the SECM scales, and between the SECM and evolution
   acceptance (Fig. 6). Our measurement model had acceptable fit to the
   data (see Table ​Table3)3) and no posteriori changes to the model were

   evolution acceptance) (represented here by a box with arrows emerging
   from it), which effectively controlled for the effects of these
   variables on all path coefficients. Assuming a correct underlying

   constant (including evolution knowledge, religiosity, and background

   Assuming a correct underlying model, the perceptions of family and

   evolution, which subsequently negatively impacted evolution acceptance.
   Specifically, controlling for all other modeled variables (including

   standard deviation increase in perceptions of family conflict and
   community conflict caused, on average, a 0.54 and 0.15 standard

   The purpose of this study was to advance empirical and conceptual work
   in evolution education by developing an instrument capable of
   productively measuring perceptions of conflict with evolution (SECM).

   functioning and the potential of the SECM to clarify the factors
   impacting evolution acceptance. Table ​Table55 summarizes the findings

   The items were also found to be measurement invariant across time,
   suggesting that respondents interpreted items similarly before and
   after evolution instruction. Therefore, the SECM could be used to make
   meaningful inferences about changes in perceptions of conflict with
   evolution in response to instruction or targeted interventions. Several
   researchers have proposed frameworks for guiding the development of
   interventions that target the compatibility of evolution and religion
   (e.g., Barnes and Brownell 2017) and the bounded nature of science
   (e.g., Nelson et al. 2019). Results from researchers who have
   implemented curricular interventions aimed at reducing conflict
   (particularly between religion and evolution) suggest that it is a
   malleable trait that can be successfully impacted by instruction (e.g.,
   Barnes and Brownell 2017; Nehm and Schonfeld 2007; Truong et al. 2018).

   and modestly with the Inclusion of Others in Self (IOS) instrument,
   which measured the perception of compatibility between family and
   evolutionary ideas. This modest correlation provides convergent
   validity evidence for the SECM, but also suggests that the perception
   of conflict (or incompatibility) (targeted by the SECM) and the
   perception of compatibility (targeted by the IOS) are not necessarily
   direct opposites of one another from a measurement perspective. More
   work on the perception of compatibility (or harmony) with evolution
   could offer different inferences and is clearly warranted.

   be valuable for other aspects of the SECM.

Using the SECM to advance evolution education research

   In order to illustrate how the SECM could advance understanding of the
   complex web of variables connected to evolution acceptance, SEM was
   used to evaluate hypothesized causal relationships among the SECM
   scales, and between the SECM and evolution acceptance. Several other
   variables shown to be important in the literature (e.g., knowledge,
   religiosity) were also collected to examine if and how the SECM
--
   conflict, with family showing a stronger and modest impact, and (ii)
   personal conflict had a significant and modest causal impact on all
   scales of evolution acceptance above and beyond the contributions of
   religiosity, evolution knowledge, and background variables. We discuss
   the implications of each of these findings below.

   It is notable that both family and community conflict had unique casual
   impacts on personal perceptions of conflict with evolution. Few studies
   have directly compared the strength of the association of community and
   family on personal conflict. Studies that have collected data at both
--
   as key roles in determining their perspectives on STEM-related career
   choice. Therefore, taken together, these studies suggest that
   perceptions of community conflict with evolution may be an important
   contributor to the personal conflict perception of URMs. Furthermore,
   if the experience of conflict within the classroom is generally agreed
--
   the differential contributors to personal conflict should be an
   important target for study and intervention. Reducing perceived
   conflict with evolution may therefore be an important goal that extends
   beyond its relationship with evolution acceptance. This is an avenue of
   research that has not to our knowledge been explored empirically.

--
   these reasons, conflict may negatively impact students’ well-being and
   academic performance. We therefore join other authors (e.g., Mead et
   al. 2015) in advocating for the disaggregation of data in evolution
   education by key identity variables (such as race) that could
   contribute to feelings of conflict and exclusion.

   We also report that personal conflict had a significant and modest
   causal impact on all scales of evolution acceptance above and beyond
   the contributions of religiosity, evolution knowledge, and background
   variables. Human evolution acceptance showed the largest impact of
   personal conflict, which indicated that while the perception of
   conflict with evolution was important for all scales of evolution
   acceptance, it may be most important for the acceptance of human
   evolution. These results suggest that the perception of conflict with
   evolution may in fact impact evolution acceptance in a manner that is
   not accounted for by other available variables. These results do not
   suggest that all theoretically important variables have been accounted
--
   could be an important contributor to perceptions of conflict.^2 As a
   next step, researchers could consider incorporating the SECM into more
   complicated SEM models that treat evolution knowledge and religiosity
   (as well as other theoretically important variables, such as religious
   denomination [see Jensen et al. 2019^3]) as part of the structural
--

   The SECM is a first (and admittedly incomplete) step towards more
   completely operationalizing and measuring conflict with evolution;
   different conceptual frameworks and measurement approaches than we have
   used may be equally valuable. Although our psychometric work was fairly
--
   extent to which the outcomes or benefits proposed by the test are
   realized (AERA et al. 2014). For example, if decreasing the perception
   of conflict with evolution decreases anxiety, increases feelings of
   belonging in the classroom, and increases evolution acceptance, then
   reducing conflict through targeted interventions should display these
   outcomes. Furthermore, if low evolution acceptance and the perception
   of conflict with evolution are barriers for students persisting in
   biology majors and seeking evolution-related careers, level of conflict
   should be a significant indirect or direct predictor of these outcomes.
   Clearly, this study is one very small step towards advancing work on
   measuring conflict with evolution.

Conclusion

   This paper introduced the SECM, an easy-to-administer instrument
   designed to measure perceptions of conflict with evolution at multiple
   scales. The SECM embodies three attributes discussed in the literature:
   (i) it addresses the hierarchical nature of human social structures
--
   the subscales may be implemented separately or together, and used in
   several theory-driven orientations. Generating robust measures of the
   perception of conflict with evolution using the SECM has the potential
   for advancing understanding of the factors accounting for evolution
   acceptance, and for informing practices and outcomes relating to
   evolution education.

Abstract

   The idea of biological evolution is not accepted by many people around
   the world, with a large disparity amongst countries. Some factors may
   act as obstacles to the acceptance of evolution, such as religion, a
   lack of openness to experience, and not understanding the nature of
   science. Although the strength of the association between evolution
   acceptance and non-scientific factors varies among studies, it is often
   assumed that resistance to evolution is the byproduct of a religious
   background. Some studies are even more specific and try to associate
   the acceptance of evolution with precise religious affiliations. We
   aimed to explore the strength of associations among nationality,
   religion, and the acceptance of evolution by students using multiple
   correspondence analysis (MCA) and statistical tools, with nationwide
   samples from two different countries. Here, we show that wider
   sociocultural factors predict the acceptance of evolution to a higher
   degree than a religious background. We carried out two nationwide data
   collections that allowed us to compare differences in the acceptance of
   evolution in Italy and Brazil by high school students who declare to
   belong to the same religion in the two countries. Roman Catholic
   students showed significant differences between the two countries, and
--
   Christians within Brazil. Our conclusions support those who argue that
   religious affiliation is not the main factor in predicting the level of
   evolution acceptance. The sociocultural environment and the level of
   evolutionary knowledge seem to be more important in this regard. These
   results open up new interpretative perspectives and provide a better
   understanding of attitudes towards evolution.

Introduction

   The acceptance of evolution has been a central topic in evolution
   education in at least the last three decades [1,2]. Researchers have
   examined numerous factors that may act as obstacles to the acceptance
   of evolution, such as religiosity, knowledge of evolutionary theory,
   the understanding of the nature of science, scientific aptitudes, and
   psychological conflicts, among others [3–6]. A major association seems
--

   A systematic literature review of the current state of research
   regarding students’ and teachers’ acceptance of evolution across Europe
   found that the level of acceptance of evolution in different
   educational settings is ambiguous. The authors argue that similar
   samples and a standardized assessment of the acceptance of evolution
   are necessary for cross-country comparisons [7].

   The use of different instruments to measure evolution acceptance could
   be a cause of conflicting research results. A variety of tests have
   been proposed, including the Measure of Acceptance of the Theory of
   evolution (MATE), which has been widely used for more than 20 years and
   recently revised [8], the Inventory of Student evolution Acceptance
   (I-SEA) [9], the Generalized Acceptance of evolution Evaluation (GAENE)
   [10], etc. It should be considered that the studies cited above differ
   in their contexts of comparison in relation to ages, countries, and
--
   measurement statistics. However, inconsistencies in the results were
   found even in the analysis of the same group with different instruments
   measuring the acceptance of evolution.

   Barnes et al. [6] conducted separate analyses using six different
   evolution acceptance instruments with the same group of students, a
   large sample of around 2,300 university students. The instruments were
   administered in a random order to avoid bias due to differential
   attention and response readiness. The results were surprising and
   showed that different instruments led to different results for the
   measure of evolution acceptance, including conflicting ones. These
   results may also be interpreted as an indication that some instruments
   need methodological revisions in the search for possible distortions
--

   Additionally, the research findings revealed a complex relationship
   between understanding evolutionary concepts (e.g. natural selection)
   and evolution acceptance [10–13]. The same lack of consensus exists
   when measuring the level of evolution knowledge, given that several
   alternative assessment tools are available and may lead to different
   results [14,15]. A study with secondary school students (aged 14–16) in
   the United Kingdom found that teaching genetics before teaching
   evolution had a significant impact on improving evolution understanding
   but did not result in a significantly increased acceptance of evolution
   [16]. This reflects a weak correlation between the knowledge and
   acceptance of evolution, which also appears to be present in
   undergraduate students. In Chilean students of 15–16 years old, it was
   found that including instruction on the nature of science in the class
   on evolution improved their acceptance significantly [17].

   Kuschmierz et al. [7] identified 56 papers from the period of 2010–2020
   regarding students’ and teachers’ knowledge and acceptance of evolution
   across 29 European countries. However, according to the authors, the
   research findings were hard to compare due to the application of
--
   data from European countries. In addition, the ambiguous results of the
   research demonstrate multiple challenges regarding measurement of
   evolution education, such as (a) inadequate definitions of key
   constructs (attitudes, acceptance, knowledge, and understanding are
   often not defined or inconsistently used in publications); (b) the
   application of diverse measurement instruments (different evolution
   acceptance instruments may produce different results, even when applied
   to the same population); (c) the multidimensionality of knowledge about
   evolution (most instruments focus on single evolutionary constructs,
   such as natural selection and related concepts).

   The authors [18] then developed an instrument to measure attitudes and
   understanding across Europe and beyond, called the “evolution Education
   Questionnaire on Acceptance and Knowledge” (EEQ). The measurement
   instrument was translated into several European languages, in the
--

   Religious beliefs are among the factors most investigated as predictors
   to the low acceptance of evolution in several studies, especially among
   some age groups, religious affiliations, and nationalities, mainly
   Christian American students [10,20,21]. Barnes et al. [22] conducted a
   study with 1898 students in eight states of the United States and found
   that 56.5% of students perceived that evolution is atheistic, with a
   higher percentage of Catholic and other Christian students. This
   perception among students may lead to an apparent conflict between
   their personal religious beliefs and evolution [23].

   In addition to Christians, those of the Muslim faith have been
   investigated, although the debate between several religions and
   evolution is more typically addressed in Western contexts [24].
   However, multifactorial models have found that once religiosity and
   other measures are accounted for, the amount of variance in acceptance
   of evolution is greatly reduced [13,25]. Mantelas and Mavrikaki [26]
   examined the acceptance of evolution and its relationship with
   religiosity among Greek university biology students. A rather weak
   correlation was found between the two factors.

   evolution is controversial among both religious and non-religious
   individuals, and inconsistent views of evolution have been evidenced in
   both groups [24,27]. The picture appears to not be static, as a sample
   of U.S. education professionals with a wide range of religious
   commitments showed a significantly higher level of acceptance than
   previous studies [28]. Moreover, the level of public acceptance of
   evolution has increased in the United States in the last decade, and
   education seems to play a significant role [29]. Thus, in certain
   social contexts, religiosity may be a main component by itself, while
   in others, evolution acceptance may depend on other factors.

   There is a tendency, which cannot be taken as unanimous, that
   associates the belief in any God (deism) as intrinsically
   anti-evolutionist [30]. One can easily remember the several references
   to the "Creator" in the Origin of Species, especially in its second
   edition, showing that this direct link is far more complex than it may
--
   and beliefs do not allow for a narrow focus on the search for one
   isolated variable. However, it has been often assumed that resistance
   to evolution is somehow a byproduct of religious background, especially
   in the United States [22,31].

   Some researchers have focused closely on specific religious groups,
   such as Pentecostal Christians, known for their literal reading of
   sacred texts and strong opposition to evolution [32]. One study was
   carried out in Brazil, where these religious groups have a growing
   influence, and tried to establish a direct correlation between the
   frequency of Pentecostal Christians and the level of rejection of
   evolution between the students of two high schools [33]. A written
   instrument was created, based on a well-known one [8], and 10 students
   were invited for semi-structured interviews [33]. Although no direct
   correlation was found, the author concluded that religious beliefs are
   important elements that shape students’ ideas, possibly introducing
   “constraints that might hinder the understanding of evolutionary
   theory” [33, p. 63].

   Another piece of research developed a survey instrument with a
   nationwide sample of the British population about the general public’s
   views of evolution. As the study had a closer focus on religion, there
   was oversampling of five different religious affiliations: Anglicans
   (or Episcopalians), Catholics, Muslims, Pentecostal Christians, and
   Independent Evangelical Christians. The results showed a strong
   rejection of evolution by Muslims, Pentecostals, and Independent
   Evangelical Christians, contrary to the position of non-religious
   people, Anglicans, and Catholics, who showed high agreement to
   statements about human evolution. The study revealed that the frequency
   of religious service attendance is a large significant predictor of
   evolution rejection among most religious groups [24, p.88]. The general
   conclusion was that religious affiliation and the degree to which
   individuals participate in religious practices affect the acceptance of
   evolution as a valid theory.

   A recent study with a large sample of almost 8000 undergraduate biology
   students in different states of the United States searched for
   correlations between religious affiliation and variables such as the
   acceptance and understanding of evolution. Using a Likert scale
   instrument, they found that Muslim undergraduate students showed
   slightly higher evolution acceptance levels than Protestant students,
   but significantly lower levels than Catholic, Jewish, Buddhist, and
   Hindu students [34].
--
   However, some researchers have been questioning the common view that
   religious affiliation is the main factor to the acceptance of
   evolution. They argue that it is more likely that people form beliefs
   congruent with their broad cultural identity, which includes but is not
   limited to religious belief [35,36]. However, most articles arguing in
   this direction are case studies and philosophical or legal debates
   about evolution vs creation in the school curricula, mostly in the U.S.
   context [37]. In addition, with few exceptions, such as the reports by
   Miller et al. [2] and Clément [36], most studies have focused on a
--
   number of Catholic Christians in the world, and Italy is the hub of
   Roman Catholicism. They follow the same basic regulations from the
   Vatican, which include explicit views on biological evolution and a
   non-literal interpretation of sacred texts. However, there are deep
   sociocultural differences due to many complex factors, including
--
   a significant rise in the creationist movement in Brazil [39]. One
   Brazilian state minister declared in 2019 that the Evangelical Church
   should fight against the introduction of the theory of evolution in
   public schools, before her recent nomination [40]. Another member of
   the federal government declared in an open ceremony that Intelligent
   Design (ID) should be introduced in Brazil’s public schools as “a
   counterpoint to the theory of evolution”, assuming that there would be
   a “creationist theory” to be taught in science lessons starting at the
   primary level [41]. Research carried out in Brazil had already showed
--
   Research on the public understanding of science has been frequent, with
   nationwide surveys since 2004 [43]. However, specific research on the
   knowledge and acceptance of evolution in Italy was scarce at that time.
   Whereas Italy is included in broader international surveys, it accounts
   only for a few targeted case studies that vary in types of audience and
   goals. Despite the scarce data, researchers indicated that rejection of
   the evolutionary theory is neither widespread nor deeply rooted in
   Italian society [44], which was confirmed by Pew Research Center
   reports. The same source recently confirmed the tendency of the rise of
   the creationist perspective in Brazil within adults, with a
   considerably lower acceptance of evolution by Christians in Brazil
   (51%) than in Italy (74%) [45].

--
   advantage of an international project focusing on youngsters who were
   beginning high school level in both countries, we prepared separate
   sets of questions about evolution so that we had the very same
   questions answered by students of the same age in the same time frame,
   during the first months of the year 2014. Targeting students at the

   comparing the concepts of belief and acceptance. Differences between
   them have long been discussed in the philosophical literature and the
   specific field of evolution education [25,27,43,49]. The overall
   picture takes belief as a subjective disposition to consider p. simply
   as a premise under the influence of the wide cultural context. A
--

   The instrument used in the recent work by Kuschmierz et al. [19],
   ATEVO, relies on eight items with statements about evolution, and
   students show their degree of agreement with each of them [51]. In the
   German context, the acceptance of evolution is defined as a “positive
   attitude” (“positive Einstellung”) towards evolution. In this regard,
   “attitude” (“Einstellung”) is defined as the level of association
   between a term or fact and its subjective evaluation, in terms of
--
   of ATEVO test may be the result of very different processes. On the one
   hand, “it remains unknown whether a person answers negatively for most
   items about evolution because he/she has a ‘bad feeling’” (“schlechtes
   Gefühl”) about evolution, in the sense of a preexisting emotional
   refusal to think on the subject. On the other hand, the rejection may
   have been the result of a long reflection leading to a rational
   conclusion that evolution is not plausible [51, p. 12].

   We adopted a clear definition of evolution acceptance despite the
   complexity of the discussion on the subject in different languages,
   taking acceptance as the expression of explicit recognition of the
   objective validity of known scientific statements about evolution under
   absolute anonymity. This definition considers two steps. The first is
   associated with scientific statements about evolution, which must be
   clear and well known, avoiding issues under discussion, for instance,
   about the origin of life. Students must show not only a positive
   attitude towards evolution but also express clearly that a statement
   based on biological evolution is considered a valid premise to
   construct a judgement about the real world.

--
   Therefore, anonymous participation must be guaranteed to every person
   who is responding to questions about religion-related subjects, such as
   biological evolution, especially when surveys are carried out within
   conservative social contexts. Under secrecy, a person may accept a
   proposition as a valid premise for argumentation, making inferences,
--
   environment and were told their answers would be under absolute
   anonymity. Previous analyses of this data bank showed surprisingly high
   mean scores of evolution acceptance within fundamentalist religious
   groups in Italy and Brazil [54]. This was also the case in a previous
   survey using a different methodology, carried out in 2010–11, where
   roughly half of Evangelical high school students in Brazil declared
   under absolute anonymity that their religion was not opposed to
   evolution [55].

   In line with the tantalizing results of the study by Barnes et al. [6]
--
   instrument was based on Likert scale items but allowed a separated
   section, which we added in both countries. However, we considered a
   different approach for these evolution items, as we were going to
   present students with factual statements that were regarded as right or
   wrong by scientists.
--
   spectrum of respondents [57]. Therefore, Likert scales may not be a
   good choice with statements expressing well-known scientific facts. In
   addition, in the case of theories of evolution, factuality is supported
   by the school context in which the questionnaires were filled out. The
   battery of items on evolution was proposed with dichotomous questions,
   given that each of them can have minimal variability.

   When evolution is considered, opinions can be expressed in terms of
   favorable and unfavorable subjective statements, such as “There is a
   significant body of data which supports evolutionary theory” [33],
   “There is strong, reliable evidence to support the theory of evolution”
   [24], or “I think there is reliable evidence to support the theory that
   describes how humans were derived from ancestral primates” [33]. In

Survey instrument

   We sought to measure evolution acceptance based on five clear
   statements related to the evolutionary theory: Earth age, the fossil
   record, common ancestry, and the origin of human beings. We included an
   item about understanding, related to deep time, as it has been
   considered a relevant barrier to evolution acceptance [59], while
   statements about human evolution are highly controversial even amongst
   biology teachers [60]. As mentioned before, the section of evolution
   provided scientific statements as a separated set of items as part of a
   longer questionnaire within the Relevance of Science Education (ROSE)
--
   the following year and applied in early 2014 in both countries [54].

   Eight items related to evolution were offered to the students under a

   Christians. This indicated that sociocultural factors played a more
   important role in the acceptance of evolution than religion itself. If

   religion played a major role.

   Previous analyses of this sample already showed significant differences
   between Brazilian and Italian students [54,63]. It was clear that when
   human evolution was specifically the focus, the level of acceptance of
   evolution was lower in both countries. The same broad results were
   found in places where the context is particularly important for the
   historical development of the theory of evolution, such as the
   Galapagos Islands [72,73]. These analyses suggest that religion plays a
   considerable role in the level of support for evolution. S1 and S2

Discussion

   Research on evolution education faced a big challenge after the
   surprising findings showing that different instruments lead to
   different rates of agreement/rejection of evolution in the same student
   population [6]. We tried to show that some instruments could have had
   problems in terms of their methodology, implying distortions for the
--
   distortions can explain, at least in part, the mentioned puzzle. In
   addition, there is not consensus in the educational community about how
   important religion is for the acceptance of evolution.

   We presented a new instrument, stating some principles on how to
   evaluate students’ opinions concerning evolution, asking clear
   positions about well-known statements on the subject and using
   nationwide samples of students of the same age (around 15 years old)
--
   on the well-known instrument “MATE”, keeping the same wording in the
   revised version [8] for the statement about humans, revealing
   difficulties of evolution in 34 countries [2]. Many studies have shown
   that when the human species is concerned, opinions about evolution tend
   to be extreme, with some people considering evolution for all organisms
   except our species [60]. This is perhaps the best item to test the
   hypothesis we have been examining, as the number of respondents of both
--
   knowledge was found in both Christian denominations in Brazil. This not
   only adds evidence to the importance of understanding this important
   concept for evolution acceptance, but also shows that education and
   religion have a strong link with nationality, adding evidence to
   previously published studies [6,24]. In our case, Italian Catholics had
   a higher acceptance as well as a higher level of understanding of
   evolution than Brazilian ones. Independent recent research obtained
   similar results, showing that Catholic and Evangelical Brazilian
   university students had low levels of knowledge about evolution [74].

   Notwithstanding this general picture found after the MCA, additional
   evidence in numerical terms supports the idea that religion alone does
   not play a major role in the acceptance of evolution, with the relative
   size of differences obtained by the Intercultural Index (IntcI). It
   tended to show small numbers (IntcI<lt;1) in cases where religion played a
--
   a common ancestor. This can be regarded as a clear-cut, widely known,
   scientific principle of common ancestry, and a basic principle for
   biological evolution. The calculated Intercultural Index for item G79
   (“Humans are descended from other primate species”) was high (IntcI =
   1.889), showing that differences within Catholics were almost twice as
--

   The general picture shows that religion plays a less important role in
   the acceptance of evolution than nationality, which should be regarded
   as the wide socio-cultural environment, including religion and
   education. Children develop a range of different worldviews, which can
   affect their position towards science and scientific statements [75].
   However, the acceptance of evolution cannot be seen as a simple output
   of a given worldview but as a complex result of several influences.

--
   scale numbers into true/false answers. Then, the Intercultural Index
   presented here could objectively show the relative importance of
   religion for evolution acceptance. If our results are to be confirmed
   in the future, this could provide considerable consequences for making
   concrete recommendations for evolution education to religious students
   in conservative and anti-science environments.

   It is important to keep in mind that the picture presented here is only
   one frame of a long film, as values are changing very rapidly, even in
   religious settings. For instance, the level of acceptance of evolution
   has improved considerably within members of some conservative Christian
   denominations whose teachings are informed by cultural barriers to
   evolution [35]. Unfortunately, change can also be noticed in the
   opposite direction, with conservative anti-evolution groups and
   religious denominations showing a growing influence around the world,
   Brazil included [39–41,74].

   Reviewer #1: This article examines compare acceptance of evolution in
   high school students in Italy and Brazil, specifically looking at 1)
   the overall differences in acceptance between countries 2) whether
   level of acceptance is associated more strongly with a specific
   Christian denomination (Roman Catholic) in both countries, and 3)
   whether acceptance of evolution by both Catholic and non-Catholic
   Christian students within each country are more similar to each other.
   The authors found that the level of evolution acceptance is more
   similar among students within each country than among Roman Catholics
   in both countries. They conclude that "the sociocultural environment
   and level of evolutionary knowledge" is more important than the
   specific religious affiliation they studied (from the abstract), and
   that "religion playing a less important role for the acceptance of
   evolution that nationality" (from lines 648-649). It is an elegant
   study and should be published.

   A study with secondary school students (aged 14–16) in the United

   significant impact on improving evolution understanding but did not
   result in a significantly increased acceptance of evolution [16]. This
   reflects a weak correlation between the knowledge and acceptance of
   evolution, which also appears to be present in undergraduate students.
   In Chilean students of 15–16 years old, it was found that including
   instruction on the nature of science in the class on evolution improved
   their acceptance significantly [17].

   Kuschmierz et al. (2020) [7] identified 56 papers from the period of
   2010–2020 regarding students’ and teachers’ knowledge and acceptance of
   evolution across 29 European countries. However, according to the
   authors, the research findings were hard to compare due to the
   application of different instruments and the assessment of different
--
   reasonably comparable data from European countries. In addition, the
   ambiguous results of the research demonstrate multiple challenges
   regarding measurement of evolution education, such as (a) inadequate
   definitions of key constructs (attitudes, acceptance, knowledge, and
   understanding are often not defined or inconsistently used in
   publications); (b) the application of diverse measurement instruments
   (different evolution acceptance instruments may produce different
   results, even when applied to the same population); (c) the
   multidimensionality of knowledge about evolution (most instruments
   focus on single evolutionary constructs, such as natural selection and
   related concepts).

Biological constraints as norms in evolution

   Mathilde Tahar^ corresponding author ^
--
   Montévil and Mossio (Journal of Theoretical Biology 372:179–191, 2015)
   have proposed to speak of constraints. In this article we analyse the
   causal power of these constraints in the evolution of biodiversity,
   i.e., their positivity, but also the modality of their action on the
   directions taken by evolution. We argue that to fully account for the
   causal power of these constraints on evolution, they must be thought of
   in terms of normativity. In this way, we want to highlight two
   characteristics of the evolutionary constraints. The first, already
   emphasised as reported by Gould (The structure of evolutionary theory,
   Harvard University Press, 2002), is that these constraints are both
   produced by and producing biological evolution and that this circular
   causation creates true novelties. The second is that this specific
   causality, which generates unpredictability in evolution, stems not
   only from the historicity of biological constraints, but also from
   their internalisation through the practices of living beings.

Introduction

   The evolution of biological forms and functions does not seem fully
   explained by the laws that make physics intelligible (Longo et al.,
   2012). evolution is less a mechanical sequence based on efficient
   causality than a process whose entities are in perpetual change (Dupré
   &amp; Nicholson, 2018; Simons, 2018). It displays a continuity of forms,
   but also a progress: the lineages evolve in certain directions, without
   the space of the possible directions being predetermined. This does not
   mean that there is no stability nor regularity in the evolutionary
   process. On the contrary, evolution appears to be highly channelled. To
   account for biological regularities, Montévil and Mossio have proposed
   a theory of constraints (2015). This concept aims to explain how a
--
   biological systems as a closure of constraints that channel biological
   processes. In this article, we will question the role of these
   constraints in evolution, beyond the scale of biological systems. Our
   aim is to account for their emergence from evolutionary history and to
   understand how they explain, and how they canalise the directions taken
   by evolution. We are therefore less interested in understanding how
   they stabilise biological systems than in identifying the causality of
   these constraints, which makes them a real driving force in evolution
   and generates biodiversity.

   The argument of this article is that biological constraints should be
   thought of as norms when trying to appreciate their causal role in the
   evolution of the biodiversity structure. It has been argued (Longo et
   al., 2012) that constraints in evolution are not necessitating their
   effects but enabling certain evolutionary directions. In this article,
   we wish to take up this idea by analysing more precisely the causal
   force of these constraints in terms of normativity, in order to give a
   concrete account of causation in evolution.

Trying to account for the regularities of evolution

   evolution appears to be a relatively determined and channelled process.
   It displays a certain coherent stability: the evolution undergone by a
   species appears as linear and progressive; we observe similarities
   between organs performing the same function in different lineages. It
--
   may be inaccessible to some species: as Fodor (2007) says, pigs will
   probably never have wings. But although there is now a solid theory of
   evolution based on Darwinism and genetics, it remains difficult to
   comprehensively account for these regularities and to fully identify
   their sources.

Τelos in evolution?

   In order to explain evolutionary regularities, attempts have sometimes
   been made to use the Aristotelian concept of telos. Dennett for
   instance conceives of evolution as the progressive actualisation of the
   different possible phenotypes within a pregiven “Design Space”: “Design
   is Aristotle’s telos, an exploitation of Order for a purpose” (1995, p.
   64), the purpose of an organ adapted to a given ecological problem.
   What would explain the regularity of evolution would be the limited
   number of available solutions, i.e., of possible phenotypes. Beyond the
   shortcomings of such a teleological approach of evolution (Grene,
   1972), the main problem with this conception is that it implies a form
   of fixism or essentialism, which would consist in thinking that all the
   possible biological forms would be given a priori, from all eternity,
   evolution being just the history of their materialization. This leads
   us back to an idealistic vision, of the same type that Darwin already
   refuted, which made the species a form existing from all time. As
   Darwin showed, species is a naturalist’s abstraction, the species being
   merely more pronounced varieties, the evolution of a lineage consisting
   of the gradual transformation of an individual difference into a
   variety, then a species (Darwin, 2001, p. 54; pp. 60–61). There are no
   pre-ordained forms, prior to evolution.

The library of mendel

   Another way of grasping the regularities in evolution (complementary to
   the first) would be to assume that there would be rules preceding
   evolution, given by genetics. This idea is present in Dennett (1995)
   who speaks of a “Library of Mendel” as a genetic repertoire latently
   indicating the possible directions of evolution. It is true that genes
   structure evolution insofar as they carry the information allowing the
   formation of the organism, and a certain number of genes or groups of
   genes are found in different lineages—such is the case of the Hox gene
--
   2138–2139). The way in which genes are expressed is not preordained and
   depends on the unique biological situation of the organism, which
   results from evolution itself.

Natural selection and the adaptation requirement

   To account for evolutionary regularities, some have proposed to
   conceive of natural selection as an algorithm that would sort through
   the genetic repertoire. According to Dawkins (1996, pp. 46–50), this
--
   to the target, the more they would reproduce. The action of natural
   selection would be comparable to that of this algorithm which
   eliminates the texts furthest from the target; in evolution, the target
   would be adaptation. Even if it takes different forms depending on the
   situation, adaptation would be maintained as the general form of an
--
   adjustment of the species to the ecosystem in which they evolve.
   Therefore, adaptation could be considered as the consistent rule of
   evolution, explained by natural selection and that would account for
   the directions taken by the evolutionary process. However, this rule
   appears to be more of an imperative of efficiency (an individual who is
   not able to survive… does not survive), a minimal condition, than a
   real principle of explanation of the form taken by biodiversity and
   morphological evolution.

Failure of these proposals

   All these attempts to account for the regularities in evolution derive
   from a static, nomological view of evolution as resulting from
   immutable laws. This is why they try to account for the observed
   stabilities in a monolithic way, even if it means falling into a
   deflationary explanation that only gives a negative account of the
   directions taken by evolution. Jointly, the entities under
   consideration (organisms, species) are seen as ontologically preceding
   evolution. This is a substantialist view of evolution, outdated since
   Darwin. evolution is the process by which species are generated and
   evolve (let us note that it is species or populations that evolve, not
   individuals); from this point of view, both species and organisms are
   secondary to evolution. They take their forms from this process, and,
   above all, they are transient in respect of the process itself.
   Biological evolution is indeed a process in the strong sense given by
   Dupré and Nicholson (2018, pp. 11–14): it is extended in time, and this
   flow of time means change. Change is thus ontologically primary with
--
   relatively stable (Miquel &amp; Hwang, 2016), or, as Peter Simons puts it
   “precipitates of processes” (Simons, 2018, p. 55). What is fundamental
   in evolution is not the entities, which are always transitory, but the
   dynamic processes that give rise to their relative stability (Soto et
   al., 2016a, 2016b).

   Thus, in order to explain the regularities in evolution, it is
   necessary to move away from a nomological and monolithic approach and
   to take into consideration their historicity.

evolutionary constraints and history

Historical constraints
--
   wish to demonstrate that these conditions alone are not enough to
   explain the diversity of forms or the dynamics of the process.
   evolution towards adaptation is subject to multiple other conditions,
   which, as Gould shows (2002, pp. 1027–1037), appear as constraints for
   a pan-adaptive explanation; since they are non-classical factors that
--
   their positivity. Gould posits two characteristics of constraint (2002,
   p. 1026):
    1. “Coherent set of causal factors that can promote evolutionary
       change”.^1
    2. “The concept of constraint must include theoretically legitimate
       and factually important positive meanings—i.e., constraints as
       directing causes of particular evolutionary changes—rather than
       only the negative connotations of structural limitations that
       prevent natural selection from crafting an alteration that would
--

   Gould distinguishes three types of constraint, all of which are linked
   to the history of organisms and thus also of evolution. The first is
   the functional constraint, which comes from natural selection, i.e.,
   the necessity of adaptation, the terms of which are set by the current
--
   determined by homological constraints between hairiness and dentition
   that originate in the phyletic singularity of mammalian development.
   These constraints are born of the evolutionary history of organisms,
   but they can also guide future evolution by canalizing evolutionary
   change. This is the case of the fontanelles, constraints specific to
   vertebrates, due to the development of the skeleton, and which
--
   “aptive triangle” based on the model of the triangle used in petrology
   (Fig. 1). Each of the vertices corresponds to one of the three
   constraints, understood as an influence canalizing evolution. To
   explain the appearance of a trait, all the three vertices should be
   considered (the trait will correspond to a point located inside the
   triangle according to the respective influence of these three idealised
   vertices). However, if the condition of evolution is the adaptation of
   organisms, an adaptation subject to internal constraints, what seems
   fundamental to understanding the respective role of these constraints
   in the appearance of a trait and thus, more broadly, the directions
   taken by evolution, is history. For it is history that explains the
   inhomogeneous distributions of organisms across the potential
   morpho-space of good organic design. The occupation of morpho-space is
--

   This conception makes it possible to account for the plurality of
   evolutionary constraints, as well as for their historicity.
   Nevertheless, their action is not only negative: they channel the
   future by opening its possibilities. If constraints were completely
   stable, the evolutionary process would only be entropic, and thus
   predictable: as time progresses, organisms would occupy more and more
   possible places in morpho-space; a decrease in organisation and an
--
   Brandon, 2010) which is opposed to the idea of entropy itself. This
   problem is taken up by Brooks and Wiley (1988). According to them,
   evolution is an entropic phenomenon (because of the variability of
   organisms, the further time goes by, the more possible genotypes, i.e.,
   possible microstates, are occupied by organisms), even though a growing
   organisation in biodiversity is observed, i.e., an increasing distance
   from randomness, both within organisms and in the structuring of
   niches. To understand this, the historical dimension of evolution and
   its constraints must be considered.

--
   from the fact that the phase space itself is historically constituted.
   It transforms while retaining something of its past structure: the
   ontogenetic constraints, born of evolution, canalise the successful
   realisation of genotypes, even if the genotypes not realised may be
   accessible microstates; certain genotypic combinations are also made

   is a measure of the entropy of the system. If this scheme is applied to
   evolutionary lineages (1988, p. 43), H[obs] measures the historically
   realized diversity. The historical exclusion of the expression of
   certain kinds of information is measured by the difference between
--

   Therefore, it is the historical dimension of constraints that gives
   them their positive dynamic. Constraints in evolution emerge from the
   evolutionary process and orient it by redefining the space of
   possibilities. Not only do they canalise change as they prevent
   biological systems from occupying all possible genetic configurations,
--
   is this creative dimension that must now be investigated.

Biological interactions and evolutionary norms

   To understand how these constraints can emerge from evolution while
   canalising it, it is necessary to grasp the very process of evolution
   in its concreteness. Dupré and Nicholson define it, in the same way as
   rain, light or fermentation, as an unowned process (2018, p. 12),
   because the entities of this process are not its substrates but its
   precipitates. Yet, in evolution, the precipitates are at the same time
   the transitory agents of this process, for evolution is the history of
   the interactions of living beings. As Fisher writes, the motor of
   evolutionary change is “in the actual life of living things; in their
   contacts and conflicts with their environments, with the outer world as
   it is to them; in their unconscious efforts to grow, or their more
   conscious efforts to move. Especially, in the vital drama of the
   success or failure of each of their enterprises” (1950, p. 184). Thus,
   it could be said that since evolution belongs to no one in particular,
   it belongs to everyone: it is a process knotted by interactions whose
   agents are in in(de)finite number, that is to say knotted by an
--
Constraints and interactions

   Indeed, if the horizon of evolution is the adaptation of organisms to
   their environment, this constraint is dynamic: it comes from a history
   and shapes this history. It is not a constraint imposed unilaterally
--
   transform this environment. The causality is not unilinear. It cannot
   be said that the niche causes the means of survival of the living being
   and its evolution, since the niche is what allows the living being to
   survive (by definition, otherwise it would not evolve in this precise
   environment). The phenotype of a living being, and its niche are
--
   the other (Fodor &amp; Piattelli-Palmarini, 2011). Niches are not waiting
   to be filled until the day when miraculously the right phenotype
   appears. The evolution of the forms of living beings cannot be
   understood as responses to the constraints set by the environment,
   since environment and its stakes are defined on the basis of phenotypic
--
   It is the history of the co-construction of the niche that supplies the
   conditions for the survival of organisms and species, thereby
   channelling the evolutionary process in certain directions that will
   produce the new constraints of the niche. Thus, these constraints are
   the products of interactions, i.e., concrete, practical relations,
--
   with their environment. Living beings are not (necessarily) cognitive
   agents, but they are agents insofar as they actively take part, through
   their interactions, in evolutionary history. “An updated account of
   evolution […] should, at least, represent adaptive evolution […] as the
   interaction of agents and their affordances. It should take seriously
   the Darwinian insight that evolution is the direct consequence of what
   organisms do” (Walsh, 2015, p. 241). Hence, constraints in evolution
   should rather be thought of as norms.

--
   Several games can be played on the same field, but only one at a time.
   Biological systems therefore obey organisational rules, and their
   playground is the boundaries defined by the planet. evolution is the
   meeting of changes in the rules of the game and of correlative changes
   in the dimensions of the playing field, inasmuch as these changes are
--

   So far, we have discussed the interaction of organisms with their
   environment, but evolution depends on multiple interactions that go far
   beyond this bilateral relationship. As Darwin himself pointed out, it
   relies on the intensity of the struggle for existence, which is not
--
   agents for access to resources that can take very various forms.
   Although we cannot exhaustively illustrate the complexity of the
   interactive processes at work in evolution (which range from
   competition between cells in development to the differentiated
   extinction of species in catastrophic upheavals), we will nevertheless
--
   One aspect of this competition is the relationship between the parasite
   and its host. This relationship has a normative dimension in that it
   channels the evolution of the two species involved, but this
   channelling is highly dependent on the way the biological agents
   interact in their unique biological situation. The interaction of the
--
   2007), is the development of a strong copulatory capacity in woodlouse
   males (Moreau &amp; Rigaud, 2003). Interactions with Wolbachia have very
   different evolutionary consequences from one species to another, but
   also within populations of the same species. It should also be
   underlined that the resistances are passed on from one generation to
--
   translates into the fact that the woodlouse must evolve to survive (it
   is a good example of the Red Queen hypothesis, Van Valen, 1973). The
   genetic constraint is also involved: evolution depends on the genetic
   variability available. But what really allows these constraints to
   orient evolution and transform the process from which they emerge, is
   the normativity of the interaction itself, as it takes different forms
   from one species to another, and from one population to another.
--
   property par excellence ‘good’ or ‘bad’, depends on the host, the
   microbe, and their interaction. It is by understanding this normative
   relationship that we can grasp the direction taken by evolution. If the
   parasite is not pathogenic, then there can be co-evolution with its
   host; if it is weakly pathogenic, there can be an ‘arms race’; if it is
   highly pathogenic, this can lead to the extinction of the host species.

   These interactions also define their own evolutionary norms in relation
   to their environment. Let’s consider two species of birds from
   different lineages. The first, due to its evolutionary history, can
   only feed on berries while the second can feed on both berries and
   seeds. Suppose that the environment contains berries and seeds in equal
   proportion: it can be assumed that the species that feeds on both
   berries and seeds will feed on the seeds, so as not to compete with the
   other species. Here there are evolutionary processes coming from
   speciation that meet and structure the ecological space. In return,
   this patterning has a retroactive effect on the evolution of these two
   species: the second species may come to lose its ability to ingest
   berries. It is in the reciprocal influence of constrained processes
   that evolutionary normativity emerges.

   Thus, the role of biological constraints in the directions taken by
   evolution depends on the diversity of organisms and their particular
   ecological situation. It is these various concrete interactions that
   explain the creativity of constraints, and which make it necessary to
   speak, in the case of evolution, of evolutionary norms.

evolutionary norms

   The word norm is used in specific cases in biology: the normal versus
--
   reaction” dealing with phenotypic plasticity (West-Eberhard, 2003;
   Woltereck, 1909). We speak of norm in a broader sense, since it is the
   very causality at work in evolution that we propose to think of as
   normative. In order to draw up an operational definition of the concept
   for evolutionary biology, let us review its different meanings. Apart
   from the strictly mathematical sense, we identify three main meanings,
   based on the definitions listed by Merriam-Webster Dictionary and ATILF
--
       directions to a practice, and it emerges from a particular context
       which comes from the very history of this practice: it is therefore
       historical or evolutionary. The norm has both a creative positivity
       (its power does not only consist in a limitation but also in the
       fact that it constitutes opportunities) and emerges from and
--

   (a) and (b) are static definitions, and therefore are not adequate for
   thinking of evolution. It is from (c) that we think we should speak of
   norms in the evolutionary process although leaving aside the cultural
   framework. These norms are:
    1. Transitory rules which are,
--
       i.e., practices giving them their power and normative meaning.

   Grasping this normativity of biological constraints in evolution also
   allows us to understand their causal modality, beyond traditional logic
   and a substantialist conception of evolution. It is not just a matter
   of replacing one word with another: constraints in evolution do have a
   normative power.

The normative power of evolutionary constraints

Their positive value

   to actualise possibilities, since as we have seen, the possible is not
   predefined in biology. They form opportunities for evolution itself

   were not predicted, and which generate real novelties.

   of a thing and its ultimate usefulness, its practical application and
   incorporation into a system of ends, are toto coelo [entirely, or
--
   requisitioned anew, transformed and directed to a new purpose’”. Rather
   than simply referring to cases of exaptation (a change in function of a
   structure in the course of evolution), Gould gives an example of what
   could be called an “overloading” (Longo, 2018, pp. 457–458) which
   further reveals the abundant and unpredictable creativity of
   evolutionary constraints. While Gould does not embrace the full
   Nietzschean analysis, he “do[es] appreciate Nietzsche’s point, which
   can be translated into evolutionary terms as the source of constraint”
   (Gould, 2002, p. 1218). He adds: “The original reason does continue to
   exert a hold upon history through the structural constraints that
--
   built for the original context” (Ibid.). This diversion through
   Nietzsche underlines the fact that the historical constraints that have
   come to crystallise in evolution also constitute reserves of
   potentialities. Gould refers to the remarkable case of overloading
   found in the black heron Egretta Ardesiaca, which uses its wings to

   There is a causal circularity coming from the perpetual
   reinterpretation of the constraints by the organisms which make them
   true evolutionary norms. From this perspective, it should be underlined
   that some constraints did not emerge from the functional vertex: there
   are some actual aptive features which were originally non-aptations.
   Their evolutionary meaning changed in the course of history. This is
   the case of the fontanelles we mentioned. This also the case of the
   repetitive DNA that Gould and Vrba describe as “nonapted features,
--
   (with secondary adaptive modification if altered)” (1982, p. 11).
   Another example provided by Gould (2002, pp. 1282–1284) which will
   enable us to apprehend the evolutionary dynamics of these constraints,
   this time on an ecological scale, is that of Linepithema humile. In
   Argentina, these ants split into colonies of genetically closer

   These examples show the creativity of constraints (3) through their
   perpetual reinterpretation. They reveal the way in which these
   reinterpretations emerge from evolution itself, as a historical process
   (2), while at the same time channelling that same process (1). But it
   is (4) that is crucial to understanding the modality of their causal
--
   constraints of these rules have provided more flexibility in their
   fecund channels than limitations through their 'forbidden places'”
   (Ibid., p. 1272). But how do these constraints orient evolution towards
   non-determined possibilities? How do they induce evolutionary change?
   By what causality do they channel evolution? There are two
   indissociable questions here: what is the exact modality of their
   causal power? And where do they get this causal power from? This is
   where we think it is crucial to understand evolutionary constraints as
   norms: these two questions are resolved if the power of these
   constraints is understood as normative.
--
   also possible, i.e., it can be false). These four modalities imply a
   pre-determined space of possibilities, and hence appear insufficient
   for thinking of the causal force of evolutionary constraints, and of
   their potential. Most physical laws entail a necessity: they indicate
   that, in a given situation, if the conditions are met, the effect will
--
   characterise the situations in which they are actualised make them
   shifting norms that do not display a predictive uniformity. And yet, if
   they widen the possibilities of evolution, they allow the organisation
   of biological phenomena, in so far as evolution is not a process that
   would tend more and more towards randomness. This is why their
   normative power cannot be considered as part of the category of
   possibility either. They orient evolution in such a way that it does
   not realise just any possibility, but some possibilities rather than
   others: the most functional and relevant ones, the possibilities
   leading to an increasingly organised evolution.

   Mumford and Anjum seek a third modal path between necessity (and its
--
Normative modality and biological practices

   But this approach seems insufficient for biological evolution, in two
   respects. On the one hand, it does not account for the reconfiguration
   of the space of possibilities specific to biological evolution. The
   authors conceive the dispositional modality as applying to any
   phenomenon. They underline that there are degrees of possibilities,
   which seem to be linked to probability. Yet, probability is a measure
   on a given space of possibilities. Thus, they do not address the truly
   innovative nature of the possibilities created during evolution. The
   authors investigate the causal link between A and its typical
   manifestation B. But in evolution, B is not predetermined, and is
   therefore not predictable no matter how much information is available
   about A. It is no coincidence that the biological example given by
   Mumford and Anjum is not borrowed from evolutionary biology. In
   evolution there are no typical manifestations, only special cases. As
   Longo puts it «biological events are rare […] in view of their
   biological specificity or historicity: each event is individually rare,
   even if this type of events happens continually in evolution and
   contribute to the construction of all phylogenetic paths” (2018, p.
   469). On the other hand, the authors underline the close link between
   the manifestation of the effect and the continuity of the process that
   causes it, but do not account for the fact that, in evolution, the
   causality displays a creative circularity: the evolutionary norms, are
   both produced by and producers of the evolutionary process. They
   indicate that what accounts for dispositionality in biology is the fact
   that life is made up of activities, but do not directly link these
--

   We believe, on the contrary, that these activities must be at the
   centre of a conception of causality in evolution, since it is they that
   account for the creativity of evolutionary constraints as well as their
   specific causality. It is because constraints arise from interactions
   that are woven by agents, and because, from this point of view, they
   constitute real biological norms, that they have the power to canalise
   evolution. To understand the causality of constraints in evolution, it
   is therefore necessary to take into consideration the agency of living
   beings. For it is living beings that internalise and manifest them
   through practices, i.e., activities that are embedded in and transform
   their living conditions and thus the rest of evolution. This is why, to
   envision this driving role of organisms in evolution, Walsh proposes an
   agent theory. For ecological constraints, for example, to have a truly
   positive action, they must form opportunities for organisms. Hence, the
--
   living themselves actively constitute the constraints to which they are
   subject, through their agency (Ibid., p. 173). Thus, the power of the
   evolutionary constraints comes from their normative part, from the way
   in which living beings internalise them in activities that create new
   constraints that can transform evolutionary history. If we look back at
   the example of the functional overloading of the black heron’s wings,
   the morphological constraint (the feathers) resulting from the
--
   processes. And in return, this constraint allowed the emergence of a
   further new practice (and therefore also a new function) through the
   use of the parasol wing. The creative circularity of evolutionary
   constraints becomes illuminating when they are understood as norms
   whose multiple meanings arise from the concrete practices of organisms
--
   concretely tied up by the agents involved, that evolvability is played
   out. Neither the historical, morphological and ecological data nor the
   imperative of adaptation determine the directions taken by evolution.
   Instead, these constraints act as norms that living beings internalise
   into biological activities canalising future evolution. Let us
   emphasise that internalisation here is not psychological nor
   subjective: living beings are not necessarily cognitive agents, but
--
   This leads us to the first point that the dispositional modality failed
   to account for: the change in the space of possibilities, and thus the
   unpredictability of evolution. The various consequences of the presence
   of Wolbachia on the evolution of its host reveal the importance of the
   internalisation of norms in interactions which are always particular
   cases. The biological norm is always local and transitory, i.e.,
   specific to a time and place in evolutionary history. And it is within
   these “rare” conditions—in the sense given by Longo (2018): specific,
   historical—that living beings experience these norms through practices
   that are also rare. Therefore, it is because evolutionary constraints
   constitute norms for living beings that they can be truly innovative:
   they owe their power to the way organisms internalise them. They arise
   from the evolutionary process as it is shaped by the activities and
   practices of living beings, but they also channel this process, and
   even generate its future possibilities, through internalisation, i.e.,
--
   them through practices in the specificity of their unique situation. It
   is precisely because these norms are internalised in the practices of
   particular agents in specific situations that evolution is truly
   unpredictable (the phase space is perpetually changing).

--
   through an equally particular or rare practice C. It is from this
   internalisation that biological constraints derive their power: they
   become norms for evolution.

Conclusion

   Our aim was to clarify the causal power of biological constraints on
   the evolution of biodiversity. We argued that this power became
   illuminating if thought of in terms of normativity. We began with a
   critical moment aimed at identifying the inadequacies of the
   explanations traditionally proposed to account for regularities in
   biology. Moving away from these nomological, often monolithic, and in
   any case static conceptions of evolution, we proposed an analysis of
   the multiple constraints that canalise the forms taken by biodiversity.
   We highlighted that these constraints were historical, and that this
--
   may be vital or fatal for the survival of organisms, and they redefine
   their conditions of existence. This led us to reconceptualise
   biological constraints in evolution in terms of evolutionary norms,
   embracing four characteristics. They appear as binding conditions for
   biological evolution (1), deriving from the evolutionary process
   itself, while channelling it and opening its future possibilities (2).
   These possibilities are not predetermined in a predefined phase space
--
   these norms in practices specific to their particular situation (4).
   Finally, we have shown that conceiving biological constraints in
   evolution as evolutionary norms allows us to shed light on the modality
   of their causal power, inadequately captured by the categories of
   traditional logic inherited from Aristotle, while accounting for the
--
   constraints, nor the work on process biology, but it is meant to
   elucidate the role of constraints on the directions taken by biological
   evolution, bringing forward the agency of living beings.

An introduction to evolution

The definition

   Biological evolution, simply put, is descent with inherited
   modification. This definition encompasses everything from small-scale
   evolution (for example, changes in the frequency of different gene
   versions in a population from one generation to the next) to
   large-scale evolution (for example, the descent of different species
   from a shared ancestor over many generations). evolution helps us to
   understand the living world around us, as well as its history.

The explanation

   Biological evolution is not simply a matter of change over time. Many
   things change over time: caterpillars turn into moths, trees lose and
   regrow their leaves, mountain ranges rise and erode, but they aren’t
   examples of biological evolution because they don’t involve descent
   with inherited modifications.

Toward a theory of evolution as multilevel learning

Significance

   Modern evolutionary theory gives a detailed quantitative description of
   microevolutionary processes that occur within evolving populations of
   organisms, but evolutionary transitions and emergence of multiple
   levels of complexity remain poorly understood. Here, we establish the
   correspondence among the key features of evolution, learning dynamics,
   and renormalizability of physical theories to outline a theory of
   evolution that strives to incorporate all evolutionary processes within
   a unified mathematical framework of the theory of learning. According
   to this theory, for example, replication of genetic material and

   Keywords: theory of learning, loss function, natural selection, major
   evolutionary transitions, origin of life

Abstract

   We apply the theory of learning to physically renormalizable systems in
   an attempt to outline a theory of biological evolution, including the
   origin of life, as multilevel learning. We formulate seven fundamental
   principles of evolution that appear to be necessary and sufficient to
   render a universe observable and show that they entail the major
   features of biological evolution, including replication and natural
   selection. It is shown that these cornerstone phenomena of biology
   emerge from the fundamental features of learning dynamics such as the
   existence of a loss function, which is minimized during learning. We
   then sketch the theory of evolution using the mathematical framework of
   neural networks, which provides for detailed analysis of evolutionary
   phenomena. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed theoretical
   framework, we derive a generalized version of the Central Dogma of
   molecular biology by analyzing the flow of information during learning
   (back propagation) and predicting (forward propagation) the environment
   by evolving organisms. The more complex evolutionary phenomena, such as
   major transitions in evolution (in particular, the origin of life),
   have to be analyzed in the thermodynamic limit, which is described in
   detail in the paper by Vanchurin et al. [V. Vanchurin, Y. I. Wolf, E.
--
   What is life? If this question is asked in the scientific rather than
   in the philosophical context, a satisfactory answer should assume the
   form of a theoretical model of the origin and evolution of complex
   systems that are identified with life (1). NASA has operationally
   defined life as follows: “Life is a self-sustaining chemical system
   capable of Darwinian evolution” (2, 3). Apart from the insistence on
   chemistry, long-term evolution that involves (random) mutation,
   diversification, and adaptation is, indeed, an intrinsic, essential
   feature of life that is not apparent in any other natural phenomena.
--
   selection itself appears to be a complex rather than an elementary
   phenomenon (4). In all evolving organisms we are aware of, for natural
   selection to kick off and to sustain long-term evolution, an essential
   condition is replication of a complex digital information carrier (a
   DNA or RNA molecule). The replication fidelity must be sufficiently
--
   blocks for replication. Thus, the origin of life is a typical
   chicken-and-egg problem (or catch-22); accurate replication is
   essential for evolution, but the mechanisms ensuring replication
   fidelity are themselves products of complex evolutionary processes (6,
   7).

   Because genome replication that underlies natural selection is itself a
   product of evolution, origin of life has to be explained outside of the
   traditional framework of evolutionary biology. Modern evolutionary
   theory, steeped in population genetics, gives a detailed and arguably,
   largely satisfactory account of microevolutionary processes: that is,
   evolution of allele frequencies in a population of organisms under
   selection and random genetic drift (8, 9). However, this theory has
   little to say about the actual history of life, especially the
--
   processes on the planetary scale. All these distinct levels jointly
   constitute the hierarchical organization of the biosphere.
   Understanding the origin and evolution of this hierarchical complexity,
   arguably, is one of the principal goals of biology.

   In large part, evolution of the multilevel organization of biological
   systems appears to be driven by solving optimization problems, which
   entails conflicts or trade-offs between optimization criteria at
   different levels or scales, leading to frustrated states, in the
   language of physics (10–12). Two notable cases in point are
   parasite–host arms races that permeate biological evolution and makes
   major contributions to the diversity and complexity of life-forms
   (13–16) and multicellular organization of complex organisms, where the
--

   Two tightly linked but distinct fundamental concepts that lie
   effectively outside the canonical narrative of evolutionary biology
   address evolution of biological complexity: major transitions in
   evolution (MTEs) (19–21) and multilevel selection (MLS) (22–27). Each
   MTE involves the emergence of a new level of organization, often
   described as an evolutionary transition in individuality. A clear-cut
   example is the evolution of multicellularity, whereby a new level of
   selection emerges, namely selection among ensembles of cells rather
   than among individual cells. Multicellular life-forms (even counting
   only complex organisms with multiple cell types) evolved on many
   independent occasions during the evolution of life (28, 29), implying
   that emergence of new levels of complexity is a major evolutionary
   trend rather than a rare, chance event.

--
   formation and persistence of long-term memory: that is, history (31,
   32). By contrast, ergodic systems have no true history because they
   reach all possible states during their evolution (at least in the large
   time limit), and thus, the only content of quasihistory of such systems
   is the transition from less probable to more probable states for purely
--
   The origin of cells, which can and probably should be equated with the
   origin of life, was the first and most momentous transition at the
   onset of biological evolution, and as such, it is outside the purview
   of evolutionary biology sensu stricto. Arguably, the theoretical
   investigation of the origin of life can be feasible only within the
   framework of an envelope theory that would incorporate biological
   evolution as a special case. It is natural to envisage such a theory as
   encompassing all nonergodic processes occurring in the universe, of
   which life is a special case, emerging under conditions that remain to
   be investigated and defined.

   Here, in pursuit of a maximally general theory of evolution, we adopt
   the formalism of the theory of machine learning (35). Importantly,
   learning here is perceived in the maximally general sense as an
--
   (22, 37, 38). Here, we assess how far this analogy extends by
   establishing the correspondence between key features of biological
   evolution and concepts as well as the mathematical formalism of
   learning theory. We make the case that loss function, which is central
   to the learning theory, can be usefully and generally employed as the
   equivalent of the fitness function in the context of evolution. Our
   original motivation was to explain major features of biological
   evolution from more general principles of physics. However, after
   formulating such principles and embedding them within the mathematical
   framework of learning, we find that the theory can potentially apply to
--
   processes that have been taking place since the big bang and chemical
   processes that directly antedated and set the stage for the origin of
   life. The central propositions of the evolution theory outlined here
   include both key physical principles (namely, hierarchy of scale,
   frequency gaps, and renormalizability) (39, 40) and major features of
--
   variables are digitized and acquire the replication capacity, resulting
   in differential reproduction depending on the loss (fitness) function
   value, which is necessary and sufficient for the onset of evolution by
   natural selection. Subsequent evolution of life involves emergence of
   many additional scales, which correspond to MTE. Hereafter, we use the
   term “evolution” to describe temporal changes of living and lifelike
   and prebiotic systems (organisms), whereas the more general term
   “dynamics” refers to temporal processes in other physical systems.

   (41–43), but the nature of the involved emergent phenomena, to our
   knowledge, has not been clarified until very recently (36). Here, we
   outline a general approach to modeling and studying evolution as
   multilevel learning, supporting the view that a distinct type of
   physical theory, namely the theory of learning (35, 36), is necessary
   to investigate the evolution of complex objects in the universe, of
   which evolution of life is a specific, even if highly remarkable form.

1. Fundamental Principles of evolution

   In this section, we attempt to formulate the minimal universal
   principles that define an observable universe, in which evolution is
   possible and perhaps, inevitable. Our analysis started from the major
   features of biological evolution discussed in the next section and
   proceeded toward the general principles. However, we begin the
   discussion with the latter for the sake of transparency and generality.
--
   What are the requirements for a universe to be observable? The
   possibility to make meaningful observations implies a degree of order
   and complexity in the observed universe emerging from evolutionary
   processes, and such evolvability itself seems to be predicated on
   several fundamental principles. It has to be emphasized that
--
   even inanimate systems endowed with the ability of feedback reaction.
   In this most general sense, observation is a prerequisite for
   evolution. We first formulate the basic principles underlying
   observability and evolvability and then, give the pertinent comments
   and explanations.
     * P1. Loss function. In any evolving system, there exists a loss
       function of time-dependent variables that is minimized during
       evolution.
     * P2. Hierarchy of scales. Evolving systems encompass multiple
       dynamical variables that change on different temporal scales (with
--

   The first principle (P1) is of special importance as the starting point
   for a formal description of evolution as a learning process. The very
   existence of a loss function implies that the dynamical system of the
   universe or simpler, the universe itself is a learning (evolving)
--
   efficient method is selection implemented in various stochastic
   algorithms (Markov Chain Monte Carlo, stochastic gradient descent,
   genetic algorithms, and more). All evolution can be perceived as an
   implementation of a stochastic learning algorithm as well. Put another
   way, learning is optimization by trial and error, and so is evolution.

   The remaining principles P2 to P7 provide sufficient conditions for
--
   limiting the number of relevant variables, constraining the complexity,
   and allowing for a coarse-grained description. This principle ensures a
   renormalizable universe capable of evolution and amenable to
   observation. Together, P2 to P4 define a universe, in which partial or
   approximate knowledge of the environment (in other words, coarse
--
   Principles P5, P6, and P7 endow evolving systems with the access to
   more advanced algorithms for learning and predicting the environment,
   paving the way for the evolution of complex systems, including
   eventually, life. These principles jointly underlie the emergence of
   the crucial phenomenon of selection (44, 45). In its simplest form,

2. Fundamental evolutionary Phenomena

   In this section, we link the fundamental principles of evolution P1 to
   P7 formulated above to the basic phenomenological features of life (E1
   to E10) and seek equivalencies in the theory of learning. The list
--
       replication of the carriers of slow-changing variables (P6), sets
       the stage for competition between evolving entities and for the
       onset of the ultimate evolutionary phenomenon, natural selection

       of frustrations and the fundamental impossibility of their
       resolution in a universally optimal manner are perpetual drivers of
       evolution and give rise to evolutionary transitions, attaining
       otherwise unreachable levels of complexity.

   groups, populations, species, communities, and more) and the substrate

       However, MLS was and remains a controversial subject in
       evolutionary biology (23, 26, 27). Intuitively and as implied by
       the Price equation (48), MLS should emerge in all evolving systems
       as long as the higher-level agency of selection possesses a
--
       particular, if organisms of a given species form populations that
       are sufficiently distinct genetically and interact competitively,
       population-level selection will ensue. evolution of biological
       systems is driven by conflicting interactions (E2) that tend to
       lead to ever-increasing complexity (12). This trend further feeds
       the propensity of these systems to form new levels of organization
       and is associated with evolutionary transitions that involve the
       advent of new units of selection at multiple levels of complexity.
       Thus, E3 can be considered a major consequence of E2.
--
       The extant biological systems (cells, multicellular organisms, and
       higher-level entities, such as populations and communities) are
       products of about 4 billion y of the evolution of life, and as
       such, they are highly, albeit not completely, optimized. As a
       consequence, the typical distribution of the effects of heritable
       changes in biological evolution comprises numerous deleterious
       changes, comparatively rare beneficial changes and common neutral
       changes, and those with fitness effects below the noise level (50).
       The preponderance of neutral and slightly deleterious changes
       provides for evolution by genetic drift whereby a population moves
       on the same level or even slightly downward on the fitness
       landscape, potentially reaching another region of the landscape

       organization of the universe (P2). Frustrated dynamical systems are
       nonergodic, which from the biological perspective, means that, once
       separated, evolutionary trajectories diverge rather than converge.
       Because most of these trajectories traverse parts of the genotype
       space with comparable fitness values, competition rarely results in

     * 2)
       In terms of evolutionary biology, fitness landscapes are rugged,
       with multiple adaptive peaks of comparable fitness (53, 54), and a
       salient trend during evolution is the spread of life-forms across
       multiple peaks as opposed to concentrating on one or few. evolution
       pushes evolving organisms to explore and occupy all available
       niches and try all possible strategies. In the context of machine

   storage and processing subsystems is a prerequisite for efficient
   evolution that probably emerged early on the path from prebiotic
   entities to the emergence of life.

--
     * 2)
       The emergence of the separation between phenotype and genotype is a
       crucial event in prebiotic evolution. This separation is prominent
       in all known as well as hypothetical life-forms. Even when the
       phenotype and genotype roles are fulfilled by chemically identical
       molecules, as in the RNA world scenario of primordial evolution
       (55, 56), their roles as effectors and information storage devices
       are sharply distinct. In biological terms, the split is between

       Information copying and sharing are beneficial only if the fidelity
       exceeds a certain threshold, sometimes called Eigen limit in
       evolutionary biology (5–7). Nevertheless, in primitive prebiotic
       systems, the required fidelity level could have been quite low
       (63). For instance, even a biased chemical composition of a

       and astonishingly, the only biosphere known to us represents an
       unbroken chain of genetic information transmission that spans about
       4 billion y, commensurate with the stellar evolution scale.

E8. Natural Selection.

   evolution by natural selection (Darwinian evolution) arises from the
   combination of all the principles and phenomena described above. The
   necessary and sufficient conditions for Darwinian evolution to operate
   are 1) the existence of IPUs that are distinct from the environment and
   from each other (E1), 2) the dependence of the stability of an IPU on
--
   and transfer of information among IPUs, both vertically (to progeny)
   and horizontally. This process engenders the key feature of Darwinian
   evolution, differential reproduction of genotypes, based on the
   feedback from the environment transmitted through the phenotype.
     * 1)
       All seven fundamental principles of life-compatible universes (P1
       to P7) are involved in enabling evolution by natural selection. The
       very existence of units, on which selection can operate, hinges on
       self- vs. nonself-discrimination of prebiotic IPUs (E1) and the
--
       IPUs to replicate (P6) and expand their memory storage (genotype;
       P7, E6, and E7) provides them with access to hitherto unavailable
       degrees of freedom, making evolution an open-ended process rather
       than a quick, limited search for a local optimum.
     * 2)
       evolution by natural selection is the central tenet of evolutionary
       biology and a key part of the NASA definition of life. An important
       note on definitions is due. We already referred to selection when
       discussing prebiotic evolution (E1); however, the term “natural
       (Darwinian) selection” is here reserved for the efficient form of
       selection that emerges with the replication of dedicated
--
       environmental resources, such competition inevitably arises, except
       in the unrealistic case of unlimited supply (44). With the onset of
       Darwinian evolution, the system can be considered to cross the
       threshold from prelife to life (64, 65). The evolutionary process
       is naturally represented by movement of an evolving IPU in a
       genotype space, where proximity is defined by similarity between
       distinct genotypes and transitions correspond to elementary
       evolutionary events: that is, mutations in the most general sense
       (66). For any given environment, fitness—that is, a measure of the
       ability of a genotype to produce viable offspring—can be defined
--
E9. Parasitism.

   Parasites and host–parasite coevolution are ubiquitous across
   biological systems at multiple levels of organization and are both
   intrinsic to and indispensable for the evolution of life.
     * 1)
       Due to the flexibility of life-compatible systems (P5 and P6) and
--
       selection (P4). In particular, if population-level or kin-level
       selection is sufficiently strong, mechanisms for altruistic death
       of individual organisms apparently can be fixed in evolution (70,
       71).
     * 2)
--
       (71–73).

   To conclude this section, which we titled “fundamental evolutionary
   phenomena,” deliberately omitting “biological,” it seems important to
   note that phenomena E1 to E7 are generic, applying to all learning
--

   In the previous sections, we formulated the seven fundamental
   principles of evolution P1 to P7 and then, argued that the key
   evolutionary phenomena E1 to E10 can be interpreted and analyzed in the
   context of these principles and apparently, derived from the latter.
   The next step is to formulate a mathematical framework that would be
   consistent with the fundamental principles and thus, would allow us to
   model evolutionary phenomena analytically or numerically. For
   concreteness, the proposed framework is based on a mathematical model
   of artificial neural networks (74, 75), but we first outline a general
   optimization approach in a form suitable for modeling biological
   evolution.

   We are interested in the broadest class of optimization problems, where

   stretchy="false">gt;)<lt;/mo>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt;<lt;/msup>gt;<lt;/mrow>gt; :MATH]
   compromise the entire learning (evolution) process: that is, result in
   a substantial increase of the loss function value; these variables
   correspond to deep minima of the loss function. When the basin of

   different frequencies or in the context of biological evolution,
   between different levels of organization. For any fixed

   As will become evident shortly, the separation of these three classes
   of variables and interactions between them are central to the evolution
   and selection on all levels of organization, resulting in pervasive
   multilevel learning and selection.
--
   environment changes or under the influence of other mutations, some of
   the neutral mutations can become beneficial [a genetic phenomenon known
   as epistasis, which is pervasive in evolution (78, 79)], and in their
   entirety, neutral mutations form the essential reservoir of variation
   available for adaptive evolution (80). Even which variables are
   classified as nontrainable

--

   Now that we described an optimization problem that is suitable for
   modeling evolution of organisms (or populations of organisms), we can
   construct a mathematical framework to solve such optimization problems.
   For this purpose, we employ a mathematical theory of artificial neural
   networks (74, 75), which is simple enough to perform calculations while
   being consistent with all of the fundamental principles (P1 to P7), and
   thus, it can be used for modeling evolutionary phenomena (E1 to E10).
   We first recall a general framework of the neural network theory.

   4.1 represents fast, often stochastic environmental changes and the
   corresponding fast reaction of organisms at the phenotype level,
   whereas [4.2] reflects slower-learning dynamics of evolutionary
   adaptation via changes in the intermediate, adaptable variables: that
   is, the variable portion of the genome. The main learning objective is
--
   the same as a generation comprising from about an hour to hundreds or
   even thousands of hours. However, fixation of mutations, which
   represents an evolutionarily stable change at the genome level,
   typically takes many generations and thus, always occurs orders of
   magnitude slower than phenotype changes. Accordingly, on this

   To specify a microscopic loss function that would be appropriate for
   describing evolution and thus, give a specific form to the fundamental
   principle P1, we first note that adaptation to the environment is more
   efficient (that is, the loss function value is smaller) for a learning
--
   the environment (84). In machine learning, boundary loss functions are
   most often used in the context of supervised learning (35), and in
   biological evolution, the “supervision” comes from the environment,
   which the evolving system, such as an organism or a population, is
   learning to predict.
--
   environments.

   In the context of biological evolution, Malthusian fitness
   [MATH: <lt;mi mathvariant="italic">gt;φ<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   is defined as the expected reproductive success of a given genotype:
--
   For a microscopic description of learning, the proportionality constant
   is unimportant, but as we argue in detail in the accompanying paper
   (86), in the description of the evolutionary process from the point of
   view of thermodynamics,
   [MATH: <lt;mi>gt;T<lt;/mi>gt; :MATH]
   plays the role of “evolutionary temperature.”

   Given a concrete mathematical model of neural networks, one might
   wonder if all fundamental principles of evolution (P1 to P7) can be
   derived from this model. Such derivation would comprise additional
   evidence supporting the claim that the entire universe can be
--
   trainable variables (87). Additional gaps between levels of
   organization are also expected to appear through phase transitions as
   becomes apparent in the thermodynamic description of evolution we
   develop in the accompanying paper (86). Renormalizability (P4) is a
   direct consequence of the second law of learning (35), according to
--
   the fast-changing variables runs faster, the slow-changing variables
   can take advantage of the fast-changing ones to accelerate computation,
   which would be rewarded by evolution. The flow of information between
   slow-changing and fast-changing variables in the opposite direction is
   also beneficial because the fast-changing variables can use the
--

   Thus, the meaning of the generalized Central Dogma from the point of
   view of the learning theory—and our theory of evolution—is that slow
   dynamics (that is, evolution on a long timescale) should be mostly
   independent of the fast variables. In less formal terms, slow variables
   determine the rules of the game, and changing these rules depending on

7. Discussion

   In this work, we outline a theory of evolution on the basis of the
   theory of learning. The parallel between learning and biological
   evolution becomes obvious as soon as the mapping between the loss
   function and the fitness function is established (Eq. 4.6). Indeed,
   both processes represent movement of an evolving (learning) system on a
--
   and downward moves also occur occasionally. However, we go beyond the
   obvious analogy and trace a detailed correspondence between the
   essential features of the evolutionary and learning processes.
   Arguably, the most important fundamental commonality between evolution
   and learning is the stratification of the trainable variables (degrees
   of freedom) into classes that differ by the rate of change. At least in
   complex environments, all learning is multilevel, and so is all
   selection that is relevant for the evolutionary process. The framework
   of evolution as learning developed here implies that evolution of
   biological complexity would be impossible without MLS permeating the
   entire history of life. Under this perspective, emergence of new levels
   of organization, in learning and in evolution, and in particular, MTE
   represent genuine phase transitions as previously suggested (41). Such
   transitions can be analyzed consistently only in the thermodynamic
--
   that are too shallow to account for long-term memory that is central to
   biology (12, 41). Thus, some generalization of the spin glass concept
   is likely to be required for productive application in evolutionary
   biology (95).

--

   A fundamental shortcoming of all these approaches is that they do not
   include, at least not as a major component, evolutionary concepts, such
   as natural selection. The framework of learning theory used here allows
   us to naturally unify the descriptions of physical and biological
--

   The detailed correspondence between the key features of the processes
   of learning and biological evolution implies that this is not a simple
   analogy but rather, a reflection of the deep unity of evolutionary
   processes occurring in the universe. Indeed, separation of the relevant
   degrees of freedom into multiple temporal classes is ubiquitous in the
--
   Furthermore, scale separation and renormalizability appear to be
   essential conditions for a universe to be observable. According to the
   evolution theory outlined here, any observable universe consists of
   systems that undergo learning or synonymously, adaptive evolution, and
   actually, the universe itself is such a system (36). The famous dictum
   of Dobzhansky (98), thus, can and arguably should be rephrased as
--
   learning.”

   Within the theory of evolution outlined here, the difference between
   life and nonliving systems, however important, can be considered as one
   in the type and degree of optimization, so that all evolutionary
   phenomena can be described within the same formal framework of the
   theory of learning. Crucially, any complex optimization problem can be
--
   (genomes) that carry information on the operation of reproducers within
   which they reside (99). This is also the point when natural (Darwinian)
   selection takes off (64). Our theory of evolution implies that this
   pivotal stage was preceded by evolution of “prelife,” which comprised
   reproducers that lacked genomes but nevertheless, were learning systems
   that were subject to selection for persistence. Self-reproducing
--
   subsequently, under selection for the ability to store, express, and
   share information essential for the entire system. This key step
   greatly increased the efficiency of evolution/learning and provided for
   long-term memory that persisted throughout the history of life,
   enabling the onset of natural selection and the unprecedented
   diversification of life-forms (E5). It has to be emphasized that,
   compared with the existing evolutionary models that explore replicator
   dynamics, the learning approach described here is more microscopic in
   that the existence of replicators is not initially assumed but rather,
--
   information sharing, which in the biological context, corresponds to
   horizontal gene transfer. The essentiality of horizontal gene transfer
   at the earliest stages of life evolution is perceived as the cause of
   the universality of the translation machinery and genetic code in all
   known life-forms (101). The conceptual model of the origin of life
   implied by our learning-based theoretical framework appears to be fully
   compatible with Gánti’s chemoton, a model of protocell emergence and
   evolution based on autocatalytic reaction networks (102–104).

   The origin of life scenario within the encompassing framework of the
   present evolution theory, even if formulated in most general terms,
   implies that emergence of complexity commensurate with life is a
   general trend in the evolution of complex systems. At face value, this
   conclusion might seem to be at odds with the magnitude of
   complexification involved in the origin of life [suffice it to consider
--

   Evidently, the analysis presented here and in the accompanying paper
   (86) is only an outline of a theory of evolution as learning. The
   details and implications, including directly testable ones, remain to
   be worked out.

   In recent years, an extension of the Darwinian framework is being
   considered for the study of prebiotic chemical evolution, shifting the
   attention from homogeneous populations of naked molecular species to
   populations of heterogeneous, compartmentalized and functionally
--
   the individual units, which require an adequate characterization as
   self-maintaining systems with an internal organization, and also in
   relation to their collective and long-term evolutionary dynamics, based
   on competition, collaboration and selection processes among those
   complex individuals. On these lines, a concrete proposal for the set of
--
   autonomous functional systems, at the interface between chemistry and
   biology, is provided.
   Keywords: chemical evolution, natural selection, origins of life,
   autonomous functional systems, prebiotic systems chemistry

--
   About a century and a half ago, in his book On the Origin of Species,
   Charles R. Darwin proposed natural selection (NS) as the main driving
   force that guides the evolution of species, conceived as a process of
   descent with modification from a common ancestor. Today we have
   overwhelming evidence to support that this process has been
   continuously shaping the living world over time on the Earth and, thus,
   it constitutes a central paradigm of biology. Darwinian evolution must
   have started, at the latest, with the first population of living cells,
   whose precise characteristics remain inaccessible to us, but whose
--
   population size/structure effects, symbiotic and mutualistic
   relationships, lateral gene transfer and sex), past and current
   biodiversity is therefore regarded as the outcome of evolutionary
   dynamics based on NS from LUCA [2].

--
   that chemical level [3–5]. This widespread conception is supported by
   two breakthroughs from last half-century molecular biology: (i) the
   development of in vitro molecular evolution technologies, which allowed
   to prove that populations of biopolymers with template properties
   could, indeed, change in time under artificial selective pressure
--

   As a result, some researchers have conjectured on a possible link
   between the emerging concept of chemical evolution and the established
   notion of biological evolution, considered as two different stages of a
   common natural process of matter complexification [12–15]. Uncovering
   possible mechanisms of chemical evolution that include early or
   minimalist versions of NS would then be crucial to understand how life
   originated on Earth—or, eventually, in a different extraterrestrial
   environment. Computational and theoretical studies carried out in the
   last years support that chemical kinetics may become evolutionary
   dynamics in populations of self-replicating molecules, or in
   collectively autocatalytic networks [16–18]. The overall idea behind
   these studies is that the evolutionary potential of such chemical
   systems would result from an increase in their dynamic stability as a
   consequence of the copying process or the cross-catalytic effects among
--
   stability? Is it because experimental scientists are not finding the
   right precursors and boundary conditions? Or is it because there are
   ‘evolutionary bottlenecks’—still to be identified and
   characterized—that must be overcome to trigger off such a behaviour?
   Secondly, is ‘kinetic control’ (i.e. the rate of template copying or
--
   ensure the necessary dynamic robustness of those prebiotic systems that
   would, eventually, lead to the onset of open-ended, biological
   evolution? If not, what other types of control mechanisms or basic
   functions should be taken into account at those initial stages? More
   precisely, regarding the emergence of Darwinian evolutionary dynamics,
   how large must a primary ‘functional/phenotypic space’ be for NS to get
   established, or become operational? And, finally, granted that cyclic
--
   for research on the origins of life [28–31]. In that context, figure 1
   introduces our view about the main stages and bottlenecks involved in
   the transition from chemical to biological evolution, with emphasis on
   the evolutionary importance of establishing efficient functional
   couplings within chemical systems, as we will argue in more detail
   below. Of course, chemical evolutionary pathways (bottom part of the
   figure) will surely cover a wider research area than those potentially
   conducive to prebiotic phenomena. Nevertheless, some of them should
--
   difficulties in establishing the ‘liveliness’ of these intermediate
   chemical systems, the necessity to start integrating organizational and
   evolutionary accounts of those kinds of complex (pre-bio)molecular
   phenomena is becoming less and less controversial, and that is
   precisely the area on which we focus this short critical review or
--

   Scheme of the different stages and bottlenecks that could have occurred
   during the transition from chemical to biological evolution. Among the
   complex and interacting chemical mixtures present on early Earth, only
   those that developed the first functional couplings were available for
--
   compartment, metabolism and replication (CMR) were tightly coupled. In
   turn, only those CMR systems that became capable of open-ended
   biological evolution (see explanation in the text) would show the
   long-term robustness required to follow the pathway to LUCA and its
   further diversification into the three domains of life.

2. Merging systems chemistry and evolutionary theory

   It is turning increasingly apparent that evolutionary theory can no
   longer keep the ‘black box’ of individuality closed. In particular, the
   triad ‘multiplication, variation and heredity’ cannot be simply assumed
--
   the way to biological phenomena should be made coherent with the
   Darwinian framework, which explains the dynamics taking place at a
   population level. Oversimplifications, imposing either the evolutionary
   framework (i.e. disregarding the internal complexity of the
   individuals) or the physiological/organizational one (i.e. disregarding
   the power of evolutionary mechanisms), have not worked satisfactorily
   [32,33]. Thus, the challenge for origins-of-life research is to make
   use of systems chemistry to identify and characterize mixtures of
--
   (i.e. ‘proto-organisms’, taken as assemblies of different chemical
   species with functional attributes—see below). In parallel, researchers
   should carefully examine the evolutionary consequences of having one
   type of individual or another in the population, in terms of the
   competitive and selective dynamics that take place at that collective
--

   Two additional arguments can be given to support the necessity of
   merging the new systems approach and evolutionary theory. First, all
   known living beings are made of highly diverse and intertwined
   components and transformation processes. Simplifying their origins to
--
   reductionist conjecture, which should not be taken for granted. Second,
   in order to turn operational and lead to systems of increasing
   complexity, evolution by NS should have required, from the beginning,
   individuals who provide a wide enough space to express a phenotypic
   variety [34,35]. For example, although molecular evolution through
   artificial selection for a given phenotype (e.g. a given aptamer or an
   engineered ribozyme) has been clearly demonstrated to take place
--
   have also supported, with different strength and motivations [37–40].
   However, this is bound to pay back soon in terms of the behavioural
   richness and evolutionary potential displayed by the more complex
   individuals that are drawn in the process. Somehow (as we explain in
   more detail in the sections below), reaching that initial threshold of
   complexity would make it possible, for chemical systems that overcome a
   first set of evolutionary bottlenecks (bottom part of figure 1) and
   keep relatively robust dynamics, to display a wide range of chemical
   couplings and functional behaviours that would allow them, in turn, to
--
   an important gap remains in our understanding of the processes that
   could have spontaneously supported the emergence, maintenance and
   evolutionary potential of such a precellular world. Especially, it must
   be noted that various chemical reactions traditionally involved in the
   artificial organic syntheses of RNA precursors are thermodynamically
--
   on Earth, what systems could overcome the apparent thermodynamic
   barrier to complexification and produce the rather intricate
   self-reproducing entities that initiated evolution in a Darwinian
   sense? There is no current answer for this riddle; therefore, we need a
   more general conceptual framework to understand chemical evolution. The
   required theory should account for the increase in complexity that
   occurred in prebiotic times, when chemistry was already complex and
--
   chemistry’ [28] during the last few years.

3. Chemical evolution through the development of autonomous functional
systems

   Our perspective considers an extension of the Darwinian framework for
   the study of prebiotic chemical evolution, but not in the traditional
   way that this has been carried out within the field of origins (i.e.
   searching for minimal self-replicating molecular systems [61–65]) or,
   more recently, with the inclusion of compartments under a similar
   scheme [60,66–68]. Instead, we suggest to apply an evolutionary account
   in the context of autonomous systems that are made of diverse
   combinations of chemical precursors (i.e. (bio)molecules and their
--
   enable researchers to design experiments of competition and selection
   among different types of such individuals, in order to test their
   actual dynamic robustness and evolutionary potential.

   Central to our account is the idea of function, a key concept in
--
   naturalizing an organizational conception of function, endowed with
   biological (i.e. physiological) meaning, but well-grounded in
   evolutionary systems chemistry.

   This perspective may hold some similarities with other theoretical
   schemes recently developed with the aim to explain the evolution of
   complex systems. Pascal et al. [14], for example, argue about a
   sequence of stages in which chemical systems of increasing stability or
--
   phenomena of various kinds may synchronize and produce novel, combined
   functional advantages, as a result of which ‘synergistic wholes’ would
   become the actual units of evolutionary change. However, even if this
   account of ‘function’ highlights it as a relational concept, as we do,
   the theoretical framework where it is embedded is very different,
   centred on the evolution of biological complexity. Corning and
   Szathmary develop their ideas from an evolutionary theory background,
   discarding the paradigms of ‘self-organization’ and classical
   ‘complexity sciences’ as significant contributions to the problem. In
--
   With that aim, a first approximation to a theory of autonomous
   functional systems is put forward in the next section, including
   ingredients from evolutionary biology and also from physics and
   chemistry, so that a better understanding about basic/minimal
   biological organization can be reached (i.e. about the actual units of
   life, not just about abstract ‘units of evolution’).

4. Outline of a theory of autonomous functional systems
--
   four different though interdependent types of control mechanisms that,
   according to our view, are fundamental requirements to assemble
   autonomous functional systems with evolutionary potential to become
   biological.

--
   heterogeneity in their composition (and complexity in their dynamic
   behaviour) would constitute proper candidates as units of selection in
   this extended framework to conceive prebiotic chemical evolution. As a
   result of that evolutionary process, one could envision further
   functional diversification and more efficient integration (through new
   coupling processes), which would confer higher dynamic robustness to
--
   anchored to the cell membrane [72]. Extensive experimental work during
   the last decades suggests that, at a very primitive stage of prebiotic
   chemical evolution, these boundaries were probably lipidic in nature,
   yet involving much simpler molecular structures and compositions than
   current ones [81–83].
--
   may have played the role of a primitive energy currency, while
   aminoacyl adenylates would represent an activated form of amino acids
   with a potential evolutionary connection with central molecules of the
   current translational machinery [89,90].

--
   self-maintenance is based on far-from-equilibrium reaction cycles in
   which there is a continuous turnover of the molecular species involved.
   This reveals an unavoidable evolutionary bottleneck in any realistic
   prebiotic scenario, and this is why the fourth vertex of the
   tetrahedron, related to the capacity of controlling variability, must
--
   experimental work, must be carried out in order to determine how
   prominent variability control turns out to be during the initial stages
   of the evolutionary process, when system reproduction is probably a
   rather stochastic event [66,91,92]. Yet, there is no doubt that it must
   come into play, along with the implementation of mechanisms of heredity
--
   more robust, etc.) will remain in the population. Therefore, a
   correlation between functional properties, coupling and integrative
   mechanisms, NS and evolutionary dynamics should be drawn.

   In this respect, our intuition is that during a first period of
   prebiotic chemical evolution, fitness would be simply associated with
   the dynamic stability of protocellular systems, taken as individual
   units. Then, as a result of the collective dynamics and interactions
--
   The new properties of these selected individuals (e.g. more reliable
   reproduction, higher control of variability and more efficient
   catalysis), would, in turn, allow for new evolutionary dynamics, with a
   stronger operational power of NS. This would get progressively closer
   to an open-ended evolution type of process, like the one we observe in
   the current biosphere (corresponding to the upper layer of figure 1).
   The key evolutionary transitions that could have occurred in the
   proposed scenario, together with the corresponding molecular entities
   involved, are depicted in figure 3. The later stages of prebiotic
   evolution (sketched on the right-hand side of figure 3) are also
   relevant, but lie outside the scope of the present contribution.

Abstract

   What is the best way to teach evolution? As microevolution may be
   configured as a branch of genetics, it being a short conceptual leap
   from understanding the concepts of mutation and alleles (i.e.,
   genetics) to allele frequency change (i.e., evolution), we hypothesised
   that learning genetics prior to evolution might improve student
   understanding of evolution. In the UK, genetics and evolution are
   typically taught to 14- to 16-y-old secondary school students as
   separate topics with few links, in no particular order and sometimes
   with a large time span between. Here, then, we report the results of a
   large trial into teaching order of evolution and genetics. We modified
   extant questionnaires to ascertain students’ understanding of evolution
   and genetics along with acceptance of evolution. Students were assessed
   prior to teaching, immediately post teaching and again after several
   months. Teachers were not instructed what to teach, just to teach in a
   given order. Regardless of order, teaching increased understanding and
   acceptance, with robust signs of longer-term retention. Importantly,
   teaching genetics before teaching evolution has a significant (p <lt;
   0.001) impact on improving evolution understanding by 7% in
   questionnaire scores beyond the increase seen for those taught in the
   inverse order. For lower ability students, an improvement in evolution
   understanding was seen only if genetics was taught first. Teaching
   genetics first additionally had positive effects on genetics
   understanding, by increasing knowledge. These results suggest a simple,
   minimally disruptive, zero-cost intervention to improve evolution
   understanding: teach genetics first. This same alteration does not,
   however, result in a significantly increased acceptance of evolution,
   which reflects a weak correlation between knowledge and acceptance of
   evolution. Qualitative focus group data highlights the role of
   authority figures in determination of acceptance.

Author summary

   What is the best way to teach evolution? We hypothesised that if
   students know the fundamental concepts of genetics, then this might
   help them understand evolution better. To evaluate this, we performed a
   large trial in which pupils in United Kingdom secondary schools were
   either taught genetics and then evolution or evolution and then
   genetics. We found that the students being taught genetics first had a
   5%–10% improvement in their understanding of evolution, above that
   shown in the group taught evolution first. The change was seen in both
   higher- and foundation-ability classes. Indeed, in the foundation
   classes the genetics-first approach was the only approach that enabled
   an increase in evolution understanding. Teaching genetics first comes
   at no cost to genetics understanding (and may even improve it).
   However, the genetics-first approach was no different from the
   evolution-first approach in helping the acceptance of evolution.
   Qualitative follow-up studies indicated a major role for authority
   figures in determining acceptance, potentially explaining the weak
   correlation between understanding and acceptance. These results suggest
   a simple, minimally disruptive, zero-cost intervention to improve
   evolution understanding: teach genetics first.

Introduction

   While Dobzhansky famously wrote, “nothing in biology makes sense except
   in the light of evolution” [1], evolution remains one of the most
   misunderstood topics in biology [2–4]. Despite its importance, public
   understanding and acceptance of evolution is considered poor [5,6].
   School-level teaching of evolution is, thus, important, at the very
   least because this is often potentially the first formal introduction
   many people have to the scientific understanding of the theory. There
   are, however, concerns over its unsatisfactory teaching [5,7,8]. Many
   studies suggest that not all teachers fully understand the theory of
   evolution [9–15] and that some teachers incorporate alternative
   nonscientific explanations within evolution lessons or even avoid the
   topic completely [8,10,16,17]. Students’ grasp of evolution is often
   poor and does not always agree with the scientific understanding
   [18–21]. Commensurately, numerous studies report low levels of
   understanding among first year undergraduate students [22–24]. These
   factors likely contribute to the poor public understanding of evolution
   reported by many researchers, including in the UK context [25,26]. This
   tempts the question, what are the best methods to teach evolution?

   This issue here is currently much debated, particularly at the
   secondary school level (e.g. [27–29]). This is because the theory of
   evolution can be a controversial issue [8,16,30]. Strong opposition is
   well documented in the United States (e.g., [31–39]), but there is
   increasing concern about the impact that religious movements or strong
   cultural and social traditions may have on evolution education in other
   countries, including Northern Ireland [40], Poland [41], Turkey [42],
   and the UK [25,43]. There are also concerns that creationism has been
--
   to influence science lessons [25,43,44]. More generally, numerous
   studies have focused on impediments to understanding and acceptance of
   evolution. While religious orientation [42,45–47], prior
   acceptance/rejection of the theory of evolution [46,48,49], and views
   of authority figures including teachers and religious leaders
   [16,18,48] are commonly cited reasons, reasoning skills
   [18,19,45,48,50,51] are also considered to be of importance. However,
   there has been relatively little work focused on improving teaching and
   understanding of evolution. Much of the current evolution education
   research is based on university students or teachers and may not be
   applicable to school students. Secondary school level biology is
--

   Regardless of whether there is any real reason for concern, there is no
   research within the UK that we are aware of that investigates evolution
   acceptance and understanding amongst secondary school-aged students or
   that investigates factors that might impact understanding and
   acceptance. If concerns over evolution education are genuine, then
   research is needed to find the best way to improve the situation. If,
   however, there is less need for concern, UK students may provide an
   interesting research focus as to how best to teach evolution, which
   could be applicable not just within the UK but in countries where
   evolution acceptance is more problematic.

   As microevolution may be configured as a branch of genetics, it being a
   short conceptual leap from understanding the concepts of mutation and
   alleles (i.e., genetics) to allele frequency change (i.e., evolution),
   we hypothesised that learning genetics prior to evolution might improve
   student understanding of evolution. Prior research suggests a
   relationship between evolution acceptance and genetics understanding,
   or “genetic literacy,” exists [6]. This idea of a relationship between
   knowledge of genetics and acceptance of evolution has not been widely
   studied. It seems intuitive to hypothesise that good understanding of
   genetics should help understanding, and possibly acceptance, of
   evolution. DNA is the heritable material through which variation needed
   for evolution occurs. Moreover, as basic genetics (as opposed to
   applied genetics, genetically modified [GM] crops, cloning, etc.) is a
   relatively neutral subject and not considered controversial in the ways
   that evolution might be, teaching genetics first could be a means of
   improving evolution education without any concerns over potentially
   controversial issues.

   There are supporters of linking the teaching of evolution with
   genetics, but for the most part, this is based on opinion [28,52].
   There are also some that do not view a role for genetics as helpful,
--
   argument would seem counterproductive, as the study of genetics does
   provide further understanding of, and evidence for, the theory of
   evolution. Moreover, Darwin’s argument for the logic of Natural
   Selection in the early chapters of the Origin of Species specifically
   required a heritable component [54]. There are rare examples of studies
   in which trial teaching programmes include a sequential aspect [19],
   but overall improvements in students’ understanding of evolution and
   genetics may have been linked to the constructivist nature of the
   teaching programme, rather than the order of topics or any links made
--
   The test that we perform is based within the UK setting. Since the
   National Curriculum was introduced for schools in England and Wales in
   1988, evolution has been a compulsory part of secondary science classes
   and is currently included in GCSE (General Certificate of Education)
   science and biology examination courses, typically taught to
   14–16-year-olds [25,55]. This is when most students are first
   introduced to the theory of evolution during their school education.
   Parenthetically, this situation is changing, as evolution was
   introduced to the primary curriculum in 2014. This does not affect the
   students involved in this research study, but it will be very
--

   The secondary school biology GCSE courses involved in this research
   project contain separate modules or topics featuring evolution and
   genetics. Most of these do not specifically link evolution and
   genetics, despite the obvious relationship between the two. According
   to exam board specifications and many secondary school textbooks,
   evolution is supported by fossil evidence, but there is rarely any
   mention of genetics. Students are generally taught within “higher”- or
   “foundation”- ability classes, and the hours of tuition and exact
   content studied varies between these sets. Although both genetics and
   evolution are taught to secondary school-aged students, the order of
   these topics depends on exam boards and school or teacher preference,
   and topics are not necessarily taught consecutively.

   We hypothesise that if students learn about genetics before evolution,
   this simple intervention could have a positive impact on learning. Our
   motivation for this test is not simply one based on some limited prior
--

   In brief, we asked teachers to teach in 1 of 2 orders: genetics first
   or evolution first. As it would be unethical to request some students
   not to be taught both subjects, we have no control. Our design may be
   considered a version of a crossover design [56]. The students were
   tested before being taught, immediately after and then several months
   after. Student response we define in 3 dimensions: understanding of
   evolution, understanding of genetics, and acceptance of evolution.
   Understanding of evolution (and genetics) refers to knowledge of a
   subject and practical application of this knowledge (here, evolution
   and genetics) and is different from acceptance, which refers to
   agreement with an idea or theory or the recognition that a position is
   valid or correct (here, the theory of evolution). The quantitative
   tests were modifications of accepted tests of genetics understanding,
   evolution understanding, and evolution acceptance. We followed up with
   more limited quantitative analysis from interviews with students. With
   a large number of classes being analysed, we presumed that our attempts
--
   for a higher-tier exam, or whether they are within a lower-ability set
   and entered for a foundation-tier exam. We then ask whether teaching
   order affects the extent of change in understanding of evolution and of
   genetics. Importantly, we find evidence that teaching genetics first
   improves the understanding of evolution, but also of genetics, more
   than teaching evolution first improves both understandings. Indeed, in
   the foundation class evolution understanding goes up only if genetics
   is taught first. Finally, we address the issue of whether the same
   intervention affects acceptance of evolution. We find no evidence that
   teaching order modulates increases in evolution acceptance. This
   possibly stems from the weak correlation between understanding of
   evolution and acceptance. We employed a qualitative methodology to
   explore possible reasons for this.

Results

Understanding of genetics and evolution

Teaching has a positive impact on knowledge of evolution and genetics

   If one of the purposes of education is to impart knowledge, then one
   would hope that teaching has a positive impact on students’
   understanding of the topics being taught. We examined whether this is
   the case for evolution and genetics. Teaching has a positive impact on
   knowledge of genetics, (Fig 1A, Z = 177,834 p <lt; .001) and on knowledge
   of evolution (Fig 1B, Z = 130,876.5, p <lt; .001). Students’ knowledge of
   genetics increased by 2 marks (6%) on average, and by half a mark (8%)
   for evolution knowledge, but there was a wide range of variation.
   Teaching only had a positive impact on the evolution knowledge of 48%
   of students. 26% showed no change, and 26% showed a decrease in
   understanding.

Higher-ability students gain more knowledge of evolution

   Teaching has a positive impact on evolution understanding for
   higher-ability students (Z = 95,800.5, p <lt; .001) and for foundation
   students, (Z = 2,746, p <lt; .001). However, higher-ability students have
   a greater level of evolution understanding before teaching (W =
   223,415.5, p <lt; .001) and after teaching (W = 169,066, p <lt; .001). A

   is a significant difference between the groups after teaching, with
   higher-ability students showing a greater understanding of evolution
   compared to those from foundation sets (W = 43761, p <lt; .001), even when

Teaching genetics first increases evolution knowledge

   Does the teaching order—genetics or evolution first—make a difference
   to learning outcome? Teaching has a positive impact on evolution
   knowledge for those students who are taught genetics first (Z = 42,704,
   p <lt; .001) and for those who are taught evolution first (Z = 23,566, p <lt;
   .001). The 2 groups are not significantly different prior to learning
   these topics (W = 302,352.2, p = 0.5.), but those students who were
   taught genetics first have significantly higher post-teaching test
   scores than those who were taught evolution first (W = 267,270, p <lt;
   .001). The change in scores was thus significantly different, with
   those learning genetics first showing a greater increase in evolution
   knowledge (W = 151,199.5, p <lt; .001) (Fig 3). This change reflects a
   mean difference of 0.4 marks, representing a 7% adjustment in
   understanding. A linked approach was also utilised and confirmed these
   findings: those students who learned genetics first showed a greater
   increase in evolution knowledge than those who learned evolution first
   (W = 166,702.5, p <lt; .001). Similarly, ANCOVA with change predicted as a
   function of order with pretest scores as a covariate find that genetics

   these p values are robust to multitest correction. We note too that
   whether or not a teacher changed their order of teaching doesn’t
   predict the change in evolution knowledge (W = 70,474, p = 0.25).

   Above, we have shown that teaching genetics first appears to lead to
   increased understanding of evolution. Does this come at a cost to
   improvement of genetics understanding? One could reasonably argue that
   there is no advantage to teaching genetics first if the net result is
   an increase in evolution knowledge but at a cost of genetics
   understanding. We find that, if anything, teaching genetics first
   increases both genetic and evolution understanding.

   Those taught using either topic order show an increase in genetics
   knowledge (genetics first: Z = 63,098, p <lt; .001, evolution first: Z =
   28,941, p <lt; .001). The 2 groups are, however, significantly different

   genetics first have significantly higher post-teaching test scores than
   those students who learn about evolution first (W = 173251, p <lt; .001).

   postquestionanaires. Raw data can be found in S1 and S2 Data.

Acceptance of evolution

   Having seen that teaching has a positive impact on understanding of
   evolution and genetics, we now consider whether teaching has an impact
   on acceptance of evolution. We then consider whether student ability or
   the order in which topics are taught have any impact on evolution
   acceptance.

Teaching of evolution increases acceptance rates

   The majority of students are accepting of evolution, even before
   learning about the topic in secondary school. 78% of 1,712 students
   accept evolution before they have learned about it. Of the remaining
   students, 21% are undecided, and only 1% do not show acceptance towards
   evolution. This suggests that most students are open to learning about
   evolution in school (and indeed this was found within focus groups).
   Education has an overall positive impact on evolution acceptance. The
   proportion of 1,519 students who accept evolution increases to 85%,
   with only 14% of students undecided about evolution. 1% of students
   still have low acceptance. For definitions of acceptance
   categorisation, see Methods.
--
   scores from individual students are compared. Overall, teaching has a
   small but highly significant positive impact on students’ acceptance of
   evolution (Z = 175,242.5, p <lt; .001) (Fig 1C). The average change in
   score is 2, which represents a 3% increase in acceptance. However,
   acceptance does not increase for all students: 2/3 demonstrate a
--
   but it might be noteworthy that such a large proportion of students
   show some decrease in acceptance. Overall, we see that students that
   show larger increases in understanding of both genetics and evolution
   show larger increases in evolution acceptance (Spearman correlations:
   change in acceptance versus changes in genetics understanding: R[s] =
   0.1, p <lt; 0.0001; change in acceptance versus changes in evolution
   understanding: R[s] = 0.07, p = 0.013). There is no significant
   difference in the strength of these correlations (Monte Carlo

   from increased understanding.

Higher-ability students have greater acceptance of evolution

   Teaching has a positive impact on acceptance of evolution for both
   higher-ability students (Z = 114,312, p <lt; .001) and foundation-ability
   groups of students (Z = 6,374.5, p <lt; .001). However, higher-ability
   students had a greater level of evolution acceptance before teaching
   than foundation-ability students (W = 325,619.5, p <lt; .001), as well as
   after teaching (W = 240,955.5, p <lt; .001) (Fig 5).

   result is marginal and is sensitive to Bonferonni correction.

Topic order has no impact on evolution acceptance

   Having shown that teaching order affects evolution understanding and
   that teaching increases evolution acceptance, we now ask whether
   teaching order affects evolution acceptance as would seem a logical
   corollary of these 2 prior results. Students taught evolution first and
   students taught genetics first both showed significant increase in
   evolution acceptance after teaching (genetics first: Z = 67,718, p <lt;
   .001, evolution first: Z = 25,183.5, p <lt; .001). However, these initial
   comparisons also revealed that the 2 groups were significantly
   different before they learned about evolution and genetics (W =
   377,746.5, p = .005), but not significantly different after learning
   about these topics (W = 289,152.5, p = .07). The reasons for this are
--
   predicted by teaching order in an ANCOVA (p = 0.85).

Acceptance of evolution is more strongly correlated with genetics
understanding than evolution understanding

   Given that teaching improves evolution acceptance and understanding,
   and teaching order makes a difference to evolution understanding, it is
   curious that we detect no order effect on evolution acceptance. One
   possible reason for this is that the correlation between evolution
   understanding and acceptance is weak, and hence a small difference in
   understanding (owing to topic order) translates into such a small
--

   Even before teaching, there is a moderate, positive relationship
   between evolution acceptance and genetics understanding (R[s] = 0.42 p
   <lt; .001). Importantly, there is a strikingly weaker positive
   relationship observed between evolution acceptance and evolution
   understanding (R[s] = 0.24 p <lt; .001) and between knowledge of genetics
   and knowledge of evolution (R[s] = 0.19, p <lt; .001). The correlation
   between genetics understanding and evolution acceptance is
   significantly stronger than that between evolution understanding and
   evolution acceptance (Monte Carlo simulation, p <lt; 0.0001). We conclude
   that, perhaps surprisingly, genetics understanding correlates better
   with evolution acceptance than evolution understanding does.

   In order to better understand the part knowledge plays in acceptance,
   partial correlations were calculated for the 2 principal variables. The
   correlation between evolution acceptance and genetics knowledge, given
   understanding of evolution, is rho = 0.39. The correlation between
   evolution acceptance and evolution knowledge, controlling for genetics
   knowledge, is only 0.18. Both results are highly significant (p <lt;
   .001). Again, the correlation between genetics knowledge and evolution
   acceptance appears to be stronger than that between evolution knowledge
   and evolution acceptance.

   Correlations after teaching between evolution acceptance, genetics
   understanding, and evolution understanding all appear similar to those
   seen prior to teaching. There is significant, robust positive
   correlation between acceptance of evolution and knowledge of genetics
   (R[s] = 0.41 p <lt; .001), between acceptance of evolution and knowledge
   of evolution (R[s] = 0.27 p <lt; .001), and between understanding of
   evolution and knowledge of genetics (R[s] = 0.39 p <lt; .001) after
   teaching (Fig 6) (Correlations of all pre- and postrelationships can be
   found in Table 1). Partial correlations, again, show very similar
   correlations as seen previously: the correlation between evolution
   acceptance and genetics knowledge, controlling for evolution knowledge,
   is stronger than that between evolution acceptance and evolution
   knowledge (Table 2). The correlation between genetics understanding and
   evolution acceptance is again significantly stronger than that between
   evolution understanding and evolution acceptance (Monte Carlo
   simulation, p <lt; 0.001).

   purposes alone. Raw data can be found in S1 and S2 Data.

   These results suggest that a unit increase in evolution understanding
   is likely to have only a very small incremental effect on evolution
   acceptance as the correlation between the 2 is weak both before and
   after teaching. Thus, it is logically possible that a small increment
   to evolution understanding (owing to order effects) translates as only
   a very small increase in the weakly-correlated evolution acceptance,
   too weak to be detectable by us. It is notable that the strongest
   relationship is seen between evolution acceptance and genetics
   knowledge. While causality here is unclear and may reflect little more
   than underlying ability, this we highlight as a most enigmatic result.
   It also lays the basis for the hypothesis that better understanding of
   genetics may be an optimal strategy, if the desired end is increase in
   both evolution understanding and evolution acceptance. This, we
   suggest, is worthy of further scrutiny.

Qualitative analysis suggests authority conditions acceptance

   Our results show the positive impact on evolution understanding that
   teaching has and factors that impact this—most importantly, topic
   order. Teaching also has a positive impact on acceptance. Why, then,
   might acceptance and understanding be so poorly correlated? Qualitative
   data collected from focus groups suggest that not what is taught, but
   who evolution is taught by, is more important for acceptance. Many
   students were happy to admit that they accept evolution because it’s
   what they had been told by their parents or taught by their teachers,
   although a few students acknowledged that this is something most people

     “I don’t know if there is such evidence [for evolution], we’ve just
     been told that this is right.”

--
   Important figures were not just people that students knew. Television
   documentaries were commonly given as a source of information about
   evolution, and some students felt these, and their presenters, were
   important in helping them accept evolution:

     “Even in like TV programmes they make it really convincing as well.”
--
     —(Year 10 student)

   This student had initially felt uncomfortable about learning evolution
   due to their religious beliefs, but having the knowledge that their
   religion accepted evolution was of importance. It ensured that they
   were able to learn about evolution and not cause any disruption to the
   class. It could be argued that there are underlying issues here and
   that, ideally, students should have a better understanding of the
   nature of science and its differences from religion. However, if this
   simple teacher intervention can ensure religious students are more
   comfortable and open to learning about evolution, this may appear a
   defensible approach to take.

   Given the key findings regarding topic order, combined with the strong
   evidence found that ability has a big impact on evolution acceptance
   and evolution and genetics understanding, it is important to ask
   whether the topic order effect observed in the previous section is
   independent of ability. This is for 2 reasons. First, there is the

   students within the 2 topic orders can be found in Table 3. From this,
   it is clear that, for reasons unknown, foundation-ability students
   tended to be taught evolution first. To address the statistical concern
   as well as the pedagogical concern, analysis is therefore needed to

Teaching genetics first is best for increasing evolution knowledge for both
higher- and foundation-ability students

   Higher-ability students show significant increase in evolution
   understanding regardless of which topic order they are taught first
   (genetics first: Z = 33,239.5, p <lt; .001, evolution first: Z = 15,882.5,
   p = .004). The 2 order groups were not significantly different before
   teaching (W = 195,495.5, p = .7), but higher-ability students who
   learned about genetics first demonstrate greater evolution knowledge
   after teaching than those who were taught evolution first (W =
   1,777,056.5, p = .005). Similarly, there is a significant difference
   between the change in scores, with those taught genetics first showing
   the greater increase in knowledge of evolution (Fig 7.; W = 178,140, p
   = 1.4 x 10^−5). The difference in change was, on average, a 6.4%
   increase in knowledge of evolution.

   evolution first (n = 79).

   Data plotted here is for the subset of the data in which all students
--
   Perhaps most striking, we find that within the foundation-ability
   students, only those that were taught genetics first saw a significant
   increase in evolution understanding (genetics first: Z = 599, p <lt; .001,
   evolution first: Z = 758, p = 0.9). Those who learned about genetics
   first showed a greater increase in understanding compared to those who
   were taught evolution first (Fig 7; W = 24,172, p = 0.025, sensitive to
   Bonferonni correction). This represents a difference of about 9% in
   change in scores.

   In addition, we performed a multivariate regression to predict change
   in evolution, understanding scores with ability and topic order as
   factors, and pretest score as a covariate. This reveals that both topic
   order (estimate 0.34, p <lt; 0.001) and ability (estimate 0.28, p =
--
   show a significant increase in genetics understanding regardless of
   which topic order they are taught first (genetics first: Z = 45,985, p
   <lt; .001, evolution first: Z = 15,202.5, p <lt; .001). However, the 2 groups
   are significantly different before (W = 263,571.5, p <lt; .001) and after
   (W = 222,113.5, p <lt; .001) teaching. Therefore, a linked data approach
   has been utilised to further investigate these changes. Again, both
   linked groups show a significant increase in knowledge (genetics first:
   Z = 10,050, p <lt; .001, evolution first: Z = 13,372, p <lt; .001). There is
   a significant difference between the 2 groups after teaching (W =
   91,467.5, p <lt; 0.001) with those who learned about genetics first having
   higher post-teaching scores than those who were taught evolution first.
   Those who learned genetics first also show a greater increase in
   knowledge than those taught evolution first (W = 70,724.5, p = .002),
   supported also by ANCOVA (estimate 1.2, p = 1.4 x 10^−7).

   Foundation-ability students also show a significant increase in
   genetics understanding regardless of which topic order they are taught
   first (genetics first: Z = 1,342, p <lt; .001, evolution first: Z =
   2,099.5, p <lt; .001). The 2 groups were not significantly different
   before teaching (W = 16,048.5, p = .97), but foundation-ability
   students who learned about genetics first demonstrated greater genetics
   knowledge than those who were taught evolution first (W = 12,162, p =
   .002). There was a significant difference between the change in scores
   with those taught genetics first showing the greater change in
--
   beneficial.

Topic order has no impact on evolution acceptance in both ability groups

   Above, we found no significant effect of topic order on evolution
   acceptance. Does this apply to both ability groups? Higher-ability
   students taught either topic order show a significant increase in
   evolution acceptance (genetics first: Z = 47,143.5, p <lt; .001, evolution
   first: Z = 14,699, p <lt; .001). The 2 groups are significantly different
   before learning about evolution and genetics (W = 228,160, p = .01) but
   are similar after teaching (W = 179,555, p = .05). A linked approach is
   again used and again finds that both groups show a significant increase
   in knowledge after teaching (genetics first: Z = 12,390.5, p <lt; .001,
   evolution first: Z = 14,552, p <lt; .001). There is no significant
   difference between the post-teaching scores of the 2 groups (W =
   91,474, p = .06), nor is there any difference in the amount of change
--

   Similarly, foundation-ability students show a significant increase in
   acceptance of evolution, regardless of topic order (genetics first: Z =
   1,822, p <lt; .001, evolution first: Z = 1,370, p <lt; .001). The 2 groups
   are not significantly different before (W = 14,718.5, p = .1) or after
   (W = 10,405.5, p = .05) teaching. There was also no significant
   difference in the amount of change between the 2 order groups (W =
   6,856.5, p = .1). In addition, we performed a multivariate regression
   to predict change in evolution acceptance scores with ability and topic
   order as factors and pretest score as a covariate. This reveals that
   neither topic order (p <lt; 0.88) nor ability (p = 0.55) are predictors.
--
   with ability of students and, crucially, teaching genetics first helps
   both ability groups with no detriment to genetics understanding. That
   is to say, teaching genetics first increases understanding of evolution
   and genetics for both higher- and foundation-ability students. Topic
   order appears to have no impact on evolution acceptance, regardless of
   academic ability.

--

   The previous results have all compared understanding and acceptance
   immediately before and after students have learned about evolution and
   genetics. In order to better understand what happens after time has
   lapsed since teaching, we ask whether students retain this knowledge
--
   previously). The timing of the retention test varied between classes
   but was generally 3 to 6 months after these topics were taught, and did
   not correspond to any revision or examination of evolution or genetics.
   For many students, secondary school may be the last (if not only) time
   they learn about evolution. The responses found within these retention
   tests may therefore be representative of students’ lasting thoughts and
   understandings of these topics.
--
   representative of the larger sample.

   Teaching has a positive and long-term impact on evolution acceptance,
   genetics understanding, and evolution understanding. As previously
   observed, students show significant increase in acceptance and
   understanding immediately after learning about evolution and genetics
   (evolution acceptance: Z = 8,749.5, p <lt; .001; genetics understanding: Z
   = 8,574.5, p <lt; .001; evolution understanding: Z = 8,269, p <lt; .001).
   Perhaps surprisingly, evolution acceptance and evolution understanding
   have not changed significantly by the time of the retention test
   (evolution acceptance: Z = 16,879, p = .63; evolution understanding: Z
   = 7,479; p = .054). Genetics understanding decreased significantly
   between the post-teaching and retention tests (Z = 12,560.5, p <lt; .048).
--
   times for each of the 3 scores measures. In no case did we observe
   anything even approaching a significantly lower mean dispersion than
   expected by chance (evolution acceptance, p = 0.77; evolution
   knowledge, p = 0.56; genetics knowledge, p = 0.22). To check that this
   wasn’t an artefact of high variance when there are few recorded
   samples, we reanalysed requiring a minimum of 6 change calculations per
   class. We again find no evidence for underdispersion (evolution
   acceptance, p = 0.78; evolution knowledge, p = 0.58; genetics
   knowledge, p = 0.17). Analysing each of the 3 questions stratified into
   high and low groups similarly finds no evidence for underdispersion
--
   appropriate, it is also helpful to ask whether a much more conservative
   class-level analysis provides any support for the hypothesis that
   teaching genetics first improves evolution understanding. To address
   this, we calculated for each class a mean change (post score −
   prescore) for each of the 3 parameters (acceptance and understanding x
   2). We then performed Mann Whitney U tests for each of the 3
   parameters, comparing those classes taught evolution first with those
   taught genetics first.

--
   student-focused analysis (just 70 classes in which we have at least 1
   student doing all the pre tests and all the post tests), nonetheless we
   see that teaching genetics first significantly improves evolution
   understanding (p = 0.004), with the mean class increase in score being
   approximately double that of the evolution-first treatment (Table 4).
   Stratifying this by ability leads to an even more conservative test, as
   we have only 18 qualifying foundation-ability classes. Even in this
   stratification, however, we still see that teaching genetics first
   improves evolution understanding compared to the opposite order,
   although the effect is significant only in the larger sample size
   high-ability class (p = 0.006), where “genetics-first” changes in
   scores are over 2.5 times greater than with evolution-first (Table 4).
   In the foundation-ability class, evolution understanding change scores
   are improved in the genetics-first order, but not significantly so.
   This may be a sample size issue, as with only 9 classes in each
--
   one. We see no evidence that genetics understanding is adversely
   affected by being taught first (Table 4) and, again, no evidence that
   evolution acceptance is affected by ordering (Table 4).

   Our results suggest that, at least in the UK setting, teaching of
   evolution and genetics is in a constructive position. Teaching improves
   understanding and acceptance, these increases showing strong signs of
   longer-term retention. Overall, evolution acceptance is high among the
   diverse secondary school students that we sampled, increasing to 85%
   after teaching. This being said, some students spoke in the focus
   groups of expecting there to be more evidence for evolution than was
   presented in their lessons, this suggesting possible improvements.

   Most importantly, topic order is implicated in increasing understanding
   of these topics: students who are taught genetics before evolution have
   significantly greater knowledge of evolution and genetics, compared to
   students who are taught evolution first. Importantly, this same
   strategy appears not to be to the detriment of genetics understanding,
   which, if anything, is also improved by teaching genetics first. This
   suggests a simple, cost-free, minimally disruptive process to improve
   evolution understanding: namely, teaching genetics first. Importantly,
   too, for the foundation-ability students, only if genetics was taught
   first do we see an improvement in evolution knowledge. Given that there
   is so little cost in such a change, even if the results of our analysis
   were to prove not to be replicable, we can see little-to-no downside of
   this small switch in teaching practice. Given that teaching genetics
   first appears to be the only strategy that improves evolution
   understanding for those of foundation ability, we suggest that it might
   be negligent not to adopt this practice. Given, too, the strong
   correlation between genetics understanding and evolution acceptance, an
   optimal method to improve understanding of genetics and evolution, as
   well as to improve evolution acceptance, may be to concentrate more
   effort into the teaching of the genetic concepts that underpin the
   mechanisms of evolutionary change.

Why might order matter?
--
   synergistic explanation might be that, as nearly all of the material
   needed to understand allele frequency change is front loaded under the
   banner of genetics and not under the banner of evolution, the core
   foundational concepts were absorbed in a context that mitigates
   belief-associated cognitive biases (e.g., confirmation bias [61]). That
--
   presented under the umbrella of genetics. Once accepted, the
   cognititive dissonance [62] associated with processing information
   under the banner “evolution” might be considerably lessened, as the
   student has only one bit of information to process—alleles can change
   frequency—which, additionally, follows as a logical consequence
   (conceptual priming) of the material absorbed without confirmation
   bias. Consistent with this, we found in qualitative data numerous
   examples of students anxious about learning evolution because of their
   religious beliefs, indicative of possible cognitive dissonance.

   If the second explanation is correct, it might be best to teach
   material that is evolution under the banner “genetics” or “population
   genetics.” This “evolution by stealth” strategy could be tested by
   presenting the same “genetics first, evolution second” material under
   different banners. In the control, the students would be told
   explicitly that they are now switching to studying “evolution” and in
   the second, they would be told explicitly that they are now switching
   to studying “population genetics.” If the result is owing to any of the
--
   first year university level) and also in public engagement.

Why is evolution understanding and acceptance weakly coupled?

   Teaching evolution and genetics results in a significant increase in
   evolution acceptance, regardless of teaching order. While the “genetics
   first” option had demonstrable effects on evolution understanding, the
   same was not true for evolution acceptance. This could be explained (in
   statistical terms) as a consequence of a decoupling of evolutionary
   knowledge from acceptance of evolution. After partial correlation
   control, we report a correlation between evolution understanding and
   evolution acceptance of R = 0.18, making R^2 just ~3% (Table 2). That
   is to say, variation in one parameter explains only 3% of the variation
   in the other. As a consequence, assuming a causal arrow between
   understanding and acceptance, a small but detectable increase in
   evolution understanding owing to teaching order is expected to have, at
   most, a miniscule effect on increased evolution acceptance, so
   miniscule as to be beyond the resolution of this study, despite its
   relatively large sample sizes.

   Our qualitative analysis suggests coherent reasons for the decoupling
   of evolution understanding, not least of which is what might be
   considered “authority.” For students of a religious background, this
   appeared to be of some importance, as might be expected given the prior
   literature on religious-based impediments to acceptance of evolution in
   numerous contexts. Anecdotally, it appears that simple statements
   concerning the acceptance of evolution by key religious authority
   figures, prior to teaching, may enable some students to approach
   evolution as they would any other science. However, the data here are
   anecdotal.

--
   these terms would provide more insight into relationships with
   acceptance. Discussions with students would suggest that they know
   evidence for evolution exists, yet few are able to describe any of this
   evidence in any detail or even give examples. They appear to have
   limited understanding of evidence. However, these students are still
   accepting of evolution. This also leads to the question, what is known?
   Are there particular areas of genetics or evolution knowledge that
   provoke evolution acceptance? Or, indeed, are there specific aspects of
   genetics knowledge that enrich evolution knowledge?

Are we teaching foundation classes appropriately?

   While teaching genetics first was the only order in which the
   foundation students improved understanding of evolution, one possible
   source of concern in our results is the consistency with which teaching
   improves scores for higher-ability students more than it does for
--
   One hypothesis to address these observations is that, despite the fact
   that “genetics first” was the only strategy that led to improvements of
   evolution understanding for the foundation-ability group, what works
   for the teaching of high-ability students may not be optimal for
   foundation students. This in turns suggests the possibility of
--
   than owing to the teacher. The premise of our design was to assume that
   with enough different teachers and classes, for every exceptional
   teacher teaching evolution first, there would be an equally exceptional
   one teaching genetics first. It remains a possibility that the
   genetics-first effect was owing to especially good teachers being, by
--
   however, be properly randomised, because they were constrained as to
   order (e.g., they needed more advanced warning to buy in resources).
   However, there appear to be as many who taught evolution first as
   taught genetics first, so we don’t expect this to be a major issue.
   Nonetheless, this constraint means that our trial isn’t of the strict
--

   The null hypothesis (HO): there is no difference in terms of student
   response between the genetics-then-evolution and the
   evolution-then-genetics sequences.

   The positive hypothesis (H+): there is an advantage in terms of student
   response for genetics-then-evolution sequence over
   evolution-then-genetics sequence.

   The negative hypothesis (H−): there is an advantage in terms of student
   response for evolution-then-genetics over genetics-then-evolution
   sequence.

   Student response we define in 3 dimensions: understanding of evolution,
   understanding of genetics, and acceptance of evolution. In terms of the
   student response regarding genetics understanding, we had no prior
   supposition that order would affect its understanding and so there is
--
   a significant effect of any variety is searched for and a story told
   about the significant effect. In this context, we wish to state that
   the study design and intent were lodged with the funders, the evolution
   Education Trust in March 2011, the project starting several months
   after. The project title was “The teaching of evolution and genetics:
   an investigation into the place of knowledge about genetics in
   accepting the theory of evolution by natural selection.”

   The aim of the project was stipulated thus:

   In addition, we chose to nest the study in a survey of survey of
   understanding of 14–16-year-old UK school childrens’ understanding and
   acceptance of evolution prior to any teaching (as here reported). For
   this, samples sizes in the thousands are the norm, and this informed
   the choice to maximize. As a priori, the students have to be taught
   both streams (genetics and evolution) and no information was available
   to say if either might be better, we presumed no harm. Thus, no power
   calculation was performed. For considerations of the ideal and
--

   Quantitative data were collected through a student questionnaire to
   determine acceptance of evolution and understanding of genetics and
   evolution. This was devised for GCSE-level students (14–16-year-olds)
   who study evolution and genetics as part of their science GCSE science
   course. An advantage of analysis of this age group is that order
   effects may well be most easily detected if there has been little or no
   priming. While primary school children in the UK are presently expected
   to be taught basic genetics and evolution on the national curriculum,
   this is a recent introduction and the cohort we analysed did not have
   this exposure. Indeed, this academic stage was chosen as it is
   currently the first, and perhaps only, period at which students have to
   learn about evolution. This cohort is not self-selecting in the way
   that a higher academic stage might be. For example, students aged from
   16–18 and studying for a Biology A-Level qualification will already
--
   not have chosen to study the subject further. Therefore, in choosing to
   study GCSE-level students, this research has involved a wide variety of
   students, in terms of academic ability and interest in evolution and
   science.

   Where possible, the student questionnaire was used at 3 times:
     * Pretest—prior to learning both genetics and evolution;
     * Post-test—immediately after learning of both topics;
     * Retention test—approximately 3 to 6 months after the teaching of

   make changes to their normal teaching, such as to change the order in

   which linked the 2 topics. Due to the time constraints of teaching exam
   specifications and limited flexibility within some school schemes of

evolution acceptance

   Section A assesses students’ opinions towards evolution and consists of
   13 Likert Scale items. These were based largely on the Measure of
   Acceptance of the Theory of evolution (MATE), which was developed to
   assess biology teachers’ acceptance of evolution [64] and later,
   undergraduate students’ acceptance of evolution [65]. The original MATE
   instrument consists of 20 items spread disproportionately across 6
   subsections of evolutionary concepts or aspects. It was decided that
   this was too long for school students. Appropriate questions were
   chosen based on their relevance to these different aspects of evolution
   and their accessibility to school-aged students. Given that the MATE
   has been developed and tested predominately on teachers and

   (alpha 0.82, G6 0.83).

   to “very high acceptance,” “high acceptance,” “undecided,” “low

   total score of between 13 and 65 (a higher score represents a higher
   acceptance of evolution). The acceptance categories referred to here
   are an amalgamation of the 2 “high” and “low” acceptance categories
   (“undecided” remains unchanged) as detailed in Table 5. This is based

   including natural selection and geological time. Most of these were
   variations of questions used by Rutledge and Warden [49] in their
   research into acceptance and understanding of evolution among high
   school biology teachers. Additionally, a number of questions were
   devised with the assistance of evolution experts. Each question was
   scored equally with a section total out of 6.

   commission. Here’s how it works.

evolution

   evolution is among the most substantiated concepts in science and is
   the unifying theory of biological science. Charles Darwin
   co-originated, with Alfred Russel Wallace, the theory of evolution by
   natural selection. His masterwork, the 1859 "Origin of Species,"
   offered ample evidence for evolution having occurred, as well as the
   first strong explanation for its mechanism, natural selection. Modern
   evolutionary theory incorporates these concepts: species change over
   time; genetic mutations are responsible for the changes; individuals
   with beneficial genetic mutations will survive preferentially compared
--
   genetic changes reproductively isolate a population, that population
   has become a new species. Here you'll find news and information on
   evolution and the battle with proponents of so-called creation science.

evolution might stop humans from solving climate change, researchers say

   by Marcus Wolf, University of Maine
   evolution might stop humans from solving climate change, says new study
   Dimensions of environmental management create an attractor landscape
   for long-term human evolution. Environmental sustainability challenges
   (curved frontiers) require a minimum level of cooperation in a society
   of a certain minimum spatial size. Alternative potential paths move
   humanity toward different long-term evolutionary outcomes. In path B,
   competition between societies over common environmental resources
   creates cultural selection between groups for increasingly direct

   exploit natural resources that were refined over thousands of years
   through the process of cultural adaptation to the environment.
   University of Maine evolutionary biologist Tim Waring wanted to know
   how this process of cultural adaptation to the environment might
   influence the goal of solving global environmental problems. What he
--

   The project sought to understand three core questions: how human
   evolution has operated in the context of environmental resources, how
   human evolution has contributed to the multiple global environmental
   crises, and how global environmental limits might change the outcomes
   of human evolution in the future.

   Waring's team outlined their findings in a new paper published in
--

   The study explored how human societies' use of the environment changed
   over our evolutionary history. The research team investigated changes
   in the ecological niche of human populations, including factors such as
   the natural resources they used, how intensively they were used, what

   social systems for managing each of these.

   "Human evolution is mostly driven by cultural change, which is faster
   than genetic evolution. That greater speed of adaptation has made it
   possible for humans to colonize all habitable land worldwide," says

   technology, and these arise through regional cultural evolution. The
   presence of societies of the right scale is therefore a critical
   limiting factor.
--

   The other problem is much worse, Waring says. In a world filled with
   sub-global groups, cultural evolution among these groups will tend to
   solve the wrong problems, benefiting the interests of nations and
   corporations and delaying action on shared priorities. Cultural
   evolution among groups would tend to exacerbate resource competition
   and could lead to direct conflict between groups and even global human
   dieback.
--
   solve than previously considered," says Waring. "It's not just that
   they are the hardest thing our species has ever done. They absolutely
   are. The bigger problem is that central features in human evolution are
   likely working against our ability to solve them. To solve global
   collective challenges we have to swim upstream."
--

   Waring and his colleagues think that their analysis can help navigate
   the future of human evolution on a limited Earth. Their paper is the
   first to propose that human evolution may oppose the emergence of
   collective global problems and further research is needed to develop
   and test this theory.

   Waring's team proposes several applied research efforts to better
   understand the drivers of cultural evolution and search for ways to
   reduce global environmental competition, given how human evolution
   works. For example, research is needed to document the patterns and
   strength of human cultural evolution in the past and present. Studies
   could focus on the past processes that lead to the human domination of
   the biosphere, and on the ways cultural adaptation to the environment
   is occurring today.

   But if the general outline proves to be correct, and human evolution
   tends to oppose collective solutions to global environmental problems,
   as the authors suggest, then some very pressing questions need to be
--
   As for whether humans can continue to survive on a limited planet,
   Waring says, "We don't have any solutions for this idea of a long-term
   evolutionary trap, as we barely understand the problem. If our
   conclusions are even close to being correct, we need to study this much
   more carefully."

ENCYCLOPEDIC ENTRY

Theory of evolution

Theory of evolution

   The theory of evolution is a shortened form of the term “theory of
   evolution by natural selection,” which was proposed by Charles Darwin
   and Alfred Russel Wallace in the nineteenth century.

--
   the word, because it could not be subjected to testing that might
   support it or prove it wrong. In science, the word “theory” indicates a
   very high level of certainty. Scientists talk about evolution as a
   theory, for instance, just as they talk about Einstein’s explanation of
   gravity as a theory.
--
   A theory is an idea about how something in nature works that has gone
   through rigorous testing through observations and experiments designed
   to prove the idea right or wrong. When it comes to the evolution of
   life, various philosophers and scientists, including an
   eighteenth-century English doctor named Erasmus Darwin, proposed
   different aspects of what later would become evolutionary theory. But
   evolution did not reach the status of being a scientific theory until
   Darwin’s grandson, the more famous Charles Darwin, published his famous
   book On the Origin of Species. Darwin and a scientific contemporary of
   his, Alfred Russel Wallace, proposed that evolution occurs because of a
   phenomenon called natural selection.

--
   This means that if an environment changes, the traits that enhance
   survival in that environment will also gradually change, or evolve.
   Natural selection was such a powerful idea in explaining the evolution
   of life that it became established as a scientific theory. Biologists
   have since observed numerous examples of natural selection influencing
   evolution. Today, it is known to be just one of several mechanisms by
   which life evolves. For example, a phenomenon known as genetic drift
   can also cause species to evolve. In genetic drift, some

   Properly understood, evolution is a scientific theory about the
   development of life and is consistent with Christian theology.

Introduction

   Providing a definition of “evolution” is tricky because the word is
   used in different ways. First we need to distinguish between the
   broader worldview some associate with evolution and the scientific
   theory of evolution.

evolution as worldview

   Some people consider evolution to be equivalent to atheism, thinking it
   replaces God or otherwise rules out God’s involvement in the
   development of life. But that is a philosophical or worldview position
   (sometimes called “evolutionism” or simply “naturalism”), not a
   strictly scientific position.

   At BioLogos, we are against evolutionism and instead hold to the
   worldview of Christian theism. We call our position on origins
   “evolutionary Creation.” That is to say, we believe God is the Creator
   and also accept that evolution is the best scientific description for
   how life has developed. This is similar to saying we believe God
   provides for the growth and development of plants while we also accept
--
   for that process.

evolution as a scientific theory

   In non-scientific contexts, “theory” usually means something like a
   guess (e.g., I have a theory about…). But in its scientific sense, a
   theory is a tested and well-confirmed explanation for a set of
   observations. The observations explained by the theory of evolution
   come primarily from the fossil record, comparative morphology,
   biogeography, and now most importantly, genetics. evolution does not
   attempt to give a scientific explanation for the origin of life, but
   only for the development and diversification of lifeforms after the
   first life began.

   The theory of evolution states that all the lifeforms on earth share a
   common ancestor as a result of variation and selection over a very long
   time (currently thought to be around 4 billion years). Variation means
--
   variations were preserved in each group. Eventually the characteristics
   of each group were different enough for scientists to recognize them as
   different species. The theory of evolution claims that a similar story
   could be told for the ancestral lineage of any two species that have
   ever lived.

Debates about evolution

   There is very little debate in the scientific community about this
   broad characterization of evolution (anyone who claims otherwise is
   either uninformed or deliberately trying to mislead). The observational
   evidence explained by common ancestry is overwhelming. Of course new
--

   But that is not to say there are no debates and controversies about
   evolution among those who accept this core view of the theory.
   evolutionary scientists debate the extent to which the variation
   element is explained by random genetic mutations, and how important
   other selection mechanisms are beyond reproductive fitness. Scientists
   have different views on topics like how gradual evolutionary change is
   and on the details of how natural selection works. And as we’ve already
   seen, there are significant differences of opinion about how to
   interpret various aspects of evolution with respect to worldviews, such
   as whether there is overall direction to evolution, and what the
   significance of evolution is for theology.

   At BioLogos we believe the best contemporary science is consistent with
   Christian theology. Find more information on evolution and the BioLogos
   perspective on origins in the other resources on this page or by

Human evolution

   Human evolution is the lengthy process of change by which people
   originated from apelike ancestors. Scientific evidence shows that the
   physical and behavioral traits shared by all people originated from
--
   “pygmy chimpanzees”) and gorillas -- share a common ancestor that lived
   between 8 and 6 million years ago. Humans first evolved in Africa, and
   much of human evolution occurred on that continent. The fossils of
   early humans who lived between 6 and 2 million years ago come entirely
   from Africa.
--
   Scientists also debate over how to identify and classify particular
   species of early humans, and about what factors influenced the
   evolution and extinction of each species.

   Early humans first migrated out of Africa into Asia probably between 2

Paleoanthropology

   Paleoanthropology is the scientific study of human evolution.
   Paleoanthropology is a subfield of anthropology, the study of human
   culture, society, and biology. The field involves an understanding of
--
   their genes, body form, physiology, and behavior. Paleoanthropologists
   search for the roots of human physical traits and behavior. They seek
   to discover how evolution has shaped the potentials, tendencies, and
   limitations of all people. For many people, paleoanthropology is an
   exciting scientific field because it investigates the origin, over
   millions of years, of the universal and defining traits of our species.
   However, some people find the concept of human evolution troubling
   because it can seem not to fit with religious and other traditional
   beliefs about how people, other living things, and the world came to

The process of evolution

   The process of evolution involves a series of natural changes that
   cause species (populations of different organisms) to arise, adapt to
   the environment, and become extinct. All species or organisms have
   originated through the process of biological evolution. In animals that
   reproduce sexually, including humans, the term species refers to a
   group whose adult members regularly interbreed, resulting in fertile

   name. In this system, modern humans are classified as Homo sapiens.

   evolution occurs when there is change in the genetic material -- the
   chemical molecule, DNA -- which is inherited from the parents, and
   especially in the proportions of different genes in a population. Genes

   and reproduction.

   evolution does not change any single individual. Instead, it changes
   the inherited means of growth and development that typify a population
   (a group of individuals of the same species living in a particular

   work well until the environment changes. Over time, genetic change can
   alter a species' overall way of life, such as what it eats, how it
   grows, and where it can live. Human evolution took place as new genetic
   variations in early ancestor populations favored new abilities to adapt
   to environmental change and so altered the human way of life.
